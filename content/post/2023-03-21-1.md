description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that microbiome structure
  is altered with HFD, and that certain taxa variants correlate with metabolic health
  and PN. Apparent links between PN-associated taxa and certain lipid species and
  nerve transcriptome-related pathways additionally provide insight into new targets
  for microbiota and the associated underlying mechanisms of action in PN. Thus, these
  findings strengthen the possibility of a gut-microbiome-peripheral nervous system
