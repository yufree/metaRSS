description: In this paper,metabolomics and network pharmacology were used to investigate
  the bioactive components of Harrisonia perforata and their possible mechanisms of
  action. Metabolites in the flowers,fruits,branches,leaves and stalks of H. perforata
  were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight
  mass spectrometry. Meanwhile,multiple statistical analysis methods including principal
  component analysis( PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares ...
