description: 'Objective: To analyze the changes of serum metabolomics in rats with
  combined injuries caused by gas explosion and explore its possible mechanism. Methods:
  In April 2018, the large coal mine gas explosion test roadway and explosion test
  system were used to simulate the gas explosion experiment. All 32 SD rats were randomly
  divided into four groups, control group (not involved in the explosion) , close
  range (40 m) group, medium range (160 m) group and long range (240 m) group, 8 in
  each ...'
