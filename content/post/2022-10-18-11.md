description: Autophagy is a controlled mechanism of intracellular self-digestion with
  functions in metabolic adaptation to stress, in development, in proteostasis and
  in maintaining cellular homeostasis in ageing. Deletion of autophagy in epidermal
  keratinocytes does not prevent the formation of a functional epidermis and the permeability
  barrier but causes increased susceptibility to damage stress and metabolic alterations
  and accelerated ageing phenotypes. We here investigated how epidermal ...
