description: Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight
  tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) was used to investigate the effect of Pterocephalus
  hookeri on serum metabolism of adjuvant arthritis(AA) model rats induced by complete
  Freund's adjuvant. After the AA model was properly induced, the serum of rats was
  collected 30 days after treatment. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS chromatograms were collected and
  analyzed by principal component analysis(PCA) and orthogonal partial least ...
