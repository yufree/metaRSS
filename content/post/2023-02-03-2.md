description: The human gut microbiota produces dozens of small molecules that circulate
  in blood, accumulate to comparable levels as pharmaceutical drugs, and influence
  host physiology. Despite the importance of these metabolites to human health and
  disease, the origin of most microbially-produced molecules and their fate in the
  host remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover a host-microbe co-metabolic pathway
  for generation of hippuric acid, one of the most abundant organic acids in mammalian
