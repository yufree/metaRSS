description: 'CONCLUSION: Our study constructed the proanthocyanin-anthocyanin biosynthesis
  pathway of Tibetan hulless barley. A series of compounds, structural genes and TFs
  responsible for the differences between purple and white hulless barley were obtained
  in this pathway. Our study improves the understanding of the molecular mechanisms
