description: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a malignancy closely associated
  with asbestos exposure. Although early diagnosis provides a chance of effective
  treatment and better prognosis, invasive biopsy and cytological procedure are required
  for definitive diagnosis. In this study, we developed a method to differentiate
  between MPM and control cell lines, named "amino acid metabolomics," consisting
  in the assessment of the balance of their amino acid levels in the cell culture
  medium. Culture ...
