description: Nuts have long been known for their health benefits which are mainly
  contributed by their lipid components. However, the spatial distribution of lipids
  in nuts has not been firmly established. In this study, desorption electrospray
  ionization combined with ion mobility and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
  in positive and negative ion modes was applied to visualize spatially the lipids
  in eight edible nuts, namely almonds, hazelnuts, cashews, walnuts, peanuts, peach
  seeds, ...
