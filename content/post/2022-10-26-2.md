description: Patients with the renal phosphate-wasting disease X-linked hypophosphatemia
  (XLH) and Hyp mice, the murine homolog of XLH, are characterized by loss-of-function
  mutations in phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog X-linked (PHEX), leading
  to excessive secretion of the bone-derived phosphotropic hormone FGF23. The mineralization
  defect in patients with XLH and Hyp mice is caused by a combination of hypophosphatemia
  and local accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting molecules in bone. ...
