description: Recent scientific evidence suggests that chronic pain phenotypes are
  reflected in metabolomic changes. However, problems associated with chronic pain,
  such as sleep disorders or obesity, may complicate the metabolome pattern. Such
  a complex phenotype was investigated to identify common metabolomics markers at
  the interface of persistent pain, sleep, and obesity in 71 men and 122 women undergoing
  tertiary pain care. They were examined for patterns in d = 97 metabolomic markers
  that ...
