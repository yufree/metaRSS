description: Metabolomics is a valuable approach used to acquire comprehensive information
  about the set of metabolites in a cell or tissue, enabling a functional screen of
  the cellular activities in biological systems. Although metabolomics provides a
  more immediate and dynamic picture of phenotypes in comparison to the other omics,
  it is also the most complicated to measure because no single analytical technology
  can capture the extraordinary complexity of metabolite diversity in terms of structure
