description: Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) such as functional dyspepsia
  (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and debilitating attributed
  to altered gut function and gut-brain interactions. FGID can be reliably diagnosed
  based upon the symptom pattern; but in the clinical setting FD or IBS a frequent
  diagnoses of exclusion after relevant structural causes of symptoms have been ruled
  out by appropriate testing. Thus far, there is no established biomarker for FGIDs.
