  metabolism participates in various biological processes such as proliferation, apoptosis,
  migration, invasion, and maintenance of membrane homeostasis of prostate tumor cells.
  Bufadienolides, the active ingredients of Chansu, show a robust anti-proliferative
  effect against prostate cancer cells in vitro, but whether bufadienolides could
  regulate the lipid metabolism in prostate cancer has not been evaluated.</p> </span>
