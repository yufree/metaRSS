description: This study used a metabolomic approach to reveal changes in the levels
  of metabolic biomarkers and related metabolic pathways before and after Zhuang Yao
  Shuang Lu Tong Nao granule (YHT) treatment in rats with cerebral ischemia. The neurological
  deficit scores were significantly higher in the MCAO_R group than in the NC group,
  indicating that the mice had significantly impaired motor functions. The YHT group
  had significantly lower scores than the MCAO_R group, suggesting that YHT ...
