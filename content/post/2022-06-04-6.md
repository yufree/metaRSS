description: In this study, a twelve-week intervention was conducted to investigate
  the anti-obesity effects of yak bone collagen hydrolysates (YBCH) on mice with a
  high-fat diet. The obesity-associated phenotypes of mice were detected and the feces
  of mice were jointly analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.
  Results indicated that supplementation with YBCH could ameliorate the obesity-associated
  phenotypes of mice, especially with the medium dose (MD) and high dose (HD) of ...
