description: Low pH-induced alterations in gene expression profiles and organic acids
  (OA) and free amino acid (FAA) abundances were investigated in sweet orange [Citrus
  sinensis (L.) Osbeck cv. Xuegan] leaves. We identified 503 downregulated and 349
  upregulated genes in low pH-treated leaves. Further analysis indicated that low
  pH impaired light reaction and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, thereby
  lowering photosynthesis in leaves. Low pH reduced carbon and carbohydrate metabolisms,
