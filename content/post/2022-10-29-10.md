description: Gastric ulcer (GU) is a peptic disease with high morbidity and mortality
  rates affecting approximately 4% of the population throughout the world. Current
  therapies for GU are limited by the high relapse incidence and side effects. Therefore,
  novel effective antiulcer drugs are urgently needed. Ginsenosides have shown good
  anti-GU effects, and the major intestinal bacterial metabolite of ginsenosides,
  protopanaxatriol (PPT), is believed to be the active component. In this study, we
