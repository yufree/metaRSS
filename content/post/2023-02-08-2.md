description: The ability of ultraviolet radiation to suppress the immune system is
  thought to be central to both its beneficial (protection from autoimmunity) and
  detrimental (carcinogenic) effects. Previous work revealed a key role for lipids
  particularly platelet-activating factor and sphingosine-1-phosphate in mediating
  UV-induced immune suppression. We therefore hypothesized that there may be other
  UV-induced lipids that have immune regulatory roles. To assess this, mice were exposed
