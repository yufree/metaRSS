description: Metabolomics is a discipline that offers a comprehensive analysis of
  metabolites in biological samples. In the last decades, the notable evolution in
  liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry technologies has driven an exponential
  progress in LC-MS-based metabolomics. Targeted and untargeted metabolomics strategies
  are important tools in health and medical science, especially in the study of disease-related
  biomarkers, drug discovery and development, toxicology, diet, physical exercise,
