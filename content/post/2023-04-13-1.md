description: Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), which localizes molecules in a tag-free,
  spatially resolved manner, is a powerful tool for the understanding of underlying
  biochemical mechanisms of biological phenomena. When analyzing MSI data, it is essential
  to delineate regions of interest (ROIs) that correspond to tissue areas of different
  anatomical or pathological labels. Spatial segmentation, obtained by clustering
  MSI pixels according to their mass spectral similarities, is a popular approach
