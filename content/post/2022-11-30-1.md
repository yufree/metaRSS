description: 'CONCLUSION: The plasma metabolome of patients with hyperthyroidism before
  and after treatments revealed differences in the abundance of several small metabolites.
  Our findings add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism''s altered metabolome and
  associated metabolic processes and shed light on acylcarnitines as a new biomarker
  for treatment monitoring in conjunction with thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating ...'
