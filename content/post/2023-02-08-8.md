description: Vegetables are rich in flavonoids and are widely consumed in our daily
  life. However, comprehensive information on flavonoids components in vegetable varieties
  and the distribution of flavonoids with health-promoting effects in different vegetables
  are rarely investigated. Here, we analyzed the constitution of flavonoids among
  20 vegetables by widely-targeted metabolome analysis. A total of 403 flavonoids
  were detected and classified as flavonoid, flavonols, anthocyanins, isoflavones,
  ...
