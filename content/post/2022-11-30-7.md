description: The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics
  approach is a powerful technology for discovering novel biologically active molecules.
  In this study, we investigated the metabolic profiling of Orchidaceae species using
  LC-HRMS/MS data combined with chemometric methods and dereplication tools to discover
  antifungal compounds. We analyze twenty ethanolic plant extracts from Vanda and
  Cattleya (Orchidaceae) genera. Molecular networking and chemometric methods were
  used ...
