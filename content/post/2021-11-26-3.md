description: Chia, flax, and sesame seeds are well known for their nutritional quality
  and are commonly included in bakery products. So far, the development of methods
  to verify their presence and authenticity in foods is a requisite and a raised need.
  In this work we applied untargeted metabolomics to propose authenticity markers.
  Seeds were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS and 9938 features in negative mode and 9044 in
  positive mode were obtained by Mzmine. After isotopes grouping, alignment, gap-filling,
