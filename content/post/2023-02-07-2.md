  The macula is specialised towards high acuity vision and is an area that contains
  an increased density of cone photoreceptors and signal processing neurons. Different
  regions in the retina display unique susceptibility to pathology, with many retinal
  diseases primarily affecting the macula.</p> </span> <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section
