description: Lycium barbarum residue contains abundant bioactive nutrients which can
  be used as feed supplement. The fermentation treatment of plant residue can promote
  the utilization of nutrients, rumen digestion, and the growth and immunity of animals.
  Based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)
  metabolomics and in-depth transcriptome analysis, the study tested the mechanisms
  of Lycium barbarum residue (RW) and fermented Lycium barbarum residue (RFW) on ...
