description: Background Despite well-recognized differences in the atherosclerotic
  cardiovascular disease risk between men and women, sex differences in risk factors
  and sex-specific mechanisms in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
  disease remain poorly understood. Lipid metabolism plays a central role in the development
