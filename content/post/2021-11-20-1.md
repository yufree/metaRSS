description: 'CONCLUSION: F-G could protect hepatocytes by promoting the binding of
  free bile acids to glycine and taurine, and reducing the accumulation of free bile
  acids in the liver. F-G could also regulate the compensatory degree of taurine,
  decreasing the content of taurine-conjugated bile acids to protect ...'
