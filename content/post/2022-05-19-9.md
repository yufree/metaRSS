description: In this study, we performed an association analysis of metabolomics and
  transcriptomics to reveal the anthocyanin biosynthesis mechanism in a new purple-leaf
  tea cultivar Zikui (Camellia sinensis cv. Zikui) (ZK). Three glycosylated anthocyanins
  were identified, including petunidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, and
  cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and their contents were the highest in ZK leaves at 15 days.
  This is the first report on petunidin 3-O-glucoside in purple-leaf tea. ...
