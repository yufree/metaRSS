description: Definitive differences in blood metabolite profiles between obese and
  non-obese Type 2 diabetes (T2D) have not been established. We performed an LC-MS-based
  non-targeted metabolomic analysis of whole blood samples collected from subjects
  classified into 4 types, based on the presence or absence of obesity and T2D. Of
  the 125 compounds identified, 20, comprising mainly nucleobases and glucose metabolites,
  showed significant increases or decreases in the T2D group. These included ...
