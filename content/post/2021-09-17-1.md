  to provide high data quality to ensure comprehensive profiling and reliable structural
  elucidation. In this perspective, liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry
  (LC-HRMS) is the state-of-the-art technique for lipidomic analysis of biological
  samples. There are thousands of lipids in most biological samples, and therefore
