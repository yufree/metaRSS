description: This study aimed to explore the clinical practice of phospholipid metabolic
  pathways in COVID-19. In this study, 48 COVID-19 patients and 17 healthy controls
  were included. Patients were divided into mild (n=40) and severe (n=8) according
  to their severity. Phospholipid metabolites, TCA circulating metabolites, eicosanoid
  metabolites, and closely associated enzymes and transfer proteins were detected
  in the plasma of all individuals using metabolomics and proteomics assays, respectively.
