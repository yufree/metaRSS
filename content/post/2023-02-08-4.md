description: We aimed to determine the metabolomic profile of kidney cells under high
  glucose conditions and following sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor
  treatment. Targeted metabolomics using the Absolute IDQ-p180 kit was applied to
  quantify metabolites in kidney cells stimulated with high glucose (25 and 50 mM)
  and treated with SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin (2 µM). Primary cultured human tubular
  epithelial cells and podocytes were used to identify the metabolomic profile in
  high ...
