description: Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a rare form of pulmonary arterial
  hypertension (PAH) occurring in a heritable form (hPVOD) due to biallelic inactivating
  mutations of EIF2AK4 (encoding GCN2, general control nonderepressible 2) or in a
  sporadic form in older age (sPVOD), following exposure to chemotherapy or organic
  solvents. In contrast to PAH, PVOD is characterized by a particular remodeling of
  the pulmonary venous system and the obliteration of small pulmonary veins by ...
