description: We have witnessed the 2-year-long global rampage of COVID-19 caused by
  the wide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
  However, knowledge about biomarkers of the entire COVID-19 process is limited. Identification
  of the systemic features of COVID-19 will lead to critical biomarkers and therapeutic
  targets for early intervention and clinical disease course prediction. Here, we
  performed a comprehensive analysis of clinical measurements and serum metabolomics
