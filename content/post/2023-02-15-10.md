description: Although bariatric surgery is known to change the metabolome, it is unclear
  if this is specific for the intervention or a consequence of the induced bodyweight
  loss. As the weight loss after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) can hardly be mimicked
  with an evenly effective diet in humans, translational research efforts might be
  helpful. A group of 188 plasma metabolites of 46 patients from the randomized controlled
  Würzburg Adipositas Study (WAS) and from RYGB-treated rats (n = 6) as well ...
