description: Additive manufacturing (AM) or industrial 3D printing uses cutting-edge
  technologies and materials to produce a variety of complex products. However, the
  effects of the unintentionally emitted AM (nano)particles (AMPs) on human cells
  following inhalation, require further investigations. The physicochemical characterization
  of the AMPs, extracted from the filter of a Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) 3D printer
  of iron-based materials, disclosed their complexity, in terms of size, shape, ...
