description: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disease with an increasing
  annual incidence. Our previous observational study found that pregnant women with
  gestational diabetes had mild cognitive decline, which may be related to methylglyoxal
  (MGO). This study aimed to investigate whether labor pain aggravates the increase
  in MGO and explored the protective effect of epidural analgesia on metabolism in
  pregnant women with GDM based on solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography/mass...
