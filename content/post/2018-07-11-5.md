                        <p class="a-plus-plus">High-carbohydrate diets (HCD) are favoured by the aquaculture industry for economic reasons, but they can produce negative impacts on growth and induce hepatic steatosis. We hypothesised that the mechanism behind this is the reduction of hepatic betaine conten
