description: We identified circRNAs in the Cannabis sativa L. genome and examined
  their association with 28 cannabinoids in three tissues of C. sativa. Nine circRNAs
  are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of six cannabinoids. Cannabis sativa
  L. has been widely used in the production of medicine, textiles, and food for over
  2500 years. The main bioactive compounds in C. sativa are cannabinoids, which have
  multiple important pharmacological actions. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play essential
  roles in ...
