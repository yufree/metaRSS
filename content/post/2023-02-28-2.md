description: For different breeds of dogs with acute diarrhea, the gut microbiota
  and metabolome profiles are unclear. This prospective observational study analyzed
  the gut microbiomes of poodles with acute diarrhea and Labrador retrievers with
  acute diarrhea based on 16S amplicon sequencing, with respective healthy dogs as
  controls. Fecal non-target metabolomics and metagenomics were performed on poodles
  with acute diarrhea. This study found that the diversity and structure of the microbial
