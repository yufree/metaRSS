description: Tumour cells have exquisite flexibility in reprogramming their metabolism
  in order to support tumour initiation, progression, metastasis and resistance to
  therapies. These reprogrammed activities include a complete rewiring of the bioenergetic,
  biosynthetic and redox status to sustain the increased energetic demand of the cells.
  Over the last decades, the cancer metabolism field has seen an explosion of new
  biochemical technologies giving more tools than ever before to navigate this ...
