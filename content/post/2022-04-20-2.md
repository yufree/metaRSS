description: Neutropenic fever (NF) is a common complication of chemotherapy in patients
  with cancer which often prolongs hospitalization and worsens the quality of life.
  Although an empiric antimicrobial approach is used to prevent and treat NF, a clear
  etiology cannot be found in most cases. Emerging data suggest an altered microbiota-host
  crosstalk leading to NF. We profiled the serum metabolome and gut microbiome in
  longitudinal samples before and after NF in patients with acute myeloid leukemia,
