description: Sleep is a fundamental medicine for cardiac homeostasis, and sleep-deprived
  individuals are prone to higher incidences of heart attack. The lipid-dense diet
  (obesogenic diet-OBD) is a cumulative risk factor for chronic inflammation in cardiovascular
  disease; thus, understanding how sleep fragmentation (SF) in an obesity setting
  impacts immune and cardiac health is an unmet medical need. We hypothesized whether
  the co-existence of SF with OBD dysregulates gut homeostasis and ...
