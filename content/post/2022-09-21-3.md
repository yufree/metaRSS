description: Lipids are crucial components of cellular function owing to their role
  in membrane formation, intercellular signaling, energy storage, and homeostasis
  maintenance. In the brain, lipid dysregulations have been associated with the etiology
  and progression of neurodegeneration and other neurological pathologies. Hence,
  brain lipids are emerging as important potential targets for the early diagnosis
  and prognosis of neurological diseases. This review aims to highlight the significance
