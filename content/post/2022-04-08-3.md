description: Most of the chemical diversity present in the natural world derives from
  the incredible ability of enzymes to act on and control metabolism. Yet, thousands
  of enzymes have no defined function. The capacity to probe, investigate and assign
  previously unknown enzyme function with speed and confidence is therefore highly
  sought-after. Metabolomics is becoming a dominant player in the field of functional
  genomics and, when coupled with genetic tools and protein biochemistry techniques,
