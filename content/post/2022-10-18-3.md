description: Mume Fructus is a well-known herbal medicine and food with a long history
  of processing and application. Different processing methods impact the intrinsic
  quality of Mume Fructus. Thus, it is of great significance to investigate the changes
  in chemical components during processing (i.e., raw compared to the pulp and charcoal
  forms). In this study, plant metabolomics methods based on mass spectrometry detection
  were established to analyze the chemical ingredients of Mume Fructus ...
