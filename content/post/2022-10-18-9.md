description: In recent years, several studies aimed to investigate the metabolic effects
  of non-functioning or absent cyclophilin D (CypD), a crucial regulatory component
  of mitochondrial permeability transition pores. It has been reported that the lack
  of CypD affects glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the findings are controversial
  regarding the metabolic pathways involved, and most reports describe the effect
  of a high-fat diet on metabolism. We performed a lipidomic analysis of plasma and
