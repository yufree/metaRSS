description: Osthole (OST) is a simple coumarin derivative with pharmacological effects
  in many types of cancer cells. However, its role and its mechanism of action in
  breast cancer 4T1 cells remain unclear. In this study, we explored the effects and
  potential mechanisms of action of OST in 4T1 cells. The MTT, PI, and Annexin V-FITC/PI
  methods were used to evaluate the effects of OST-treated and untreated 4T1 cells
  on viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis, respectively. UPLC-Q-TOF/MS combined ...
