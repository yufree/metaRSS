description: Wantong Jingu Tablet (WJT), a mixture of traditional Chinese medicine,
  was reported to relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its pharmacological
  mechanism was not completely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate
  the therapeutic mechanisms of WJT for RA in vivo. The effects of WJT on joint pathology,
  as well as the levels of Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-3, ERK1/2, pERK1/2,
  TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were measured using collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) ...
