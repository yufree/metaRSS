description: Dalbergia sissoo is a woody plant with economic and medicinal value.
  As the pharmacological qualities and properties of the wood from this plant primarily
  depend on its extractives, in this study, the metabolomic analysis of extractives
  from its stems was carried out using UPLC-MS/MS. A total of 735 metabolites were
  detected from two groups of samples, heartwood and sapwood, with the largest number
  of terpenoids in type and the largest number of flavonoids in quantity. The PCA
