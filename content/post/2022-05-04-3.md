description: Characterization of cellular metabolic states is a technical challenge
  in biomedicine. Cellular heterogeneity caused by inherent diversity in expression
  of metabolic enzymes or due to sensitivity of metabolic reactions to perturbations,
  necessitates single cell analysis of metabolism. Heterogeneity is typically seen
  in cancer and thus, single-cell metabolomics is expectedly useful in studying cancer
  progression, metastasis, and variations in cancer drug response. However, low sample
  volumes ...
