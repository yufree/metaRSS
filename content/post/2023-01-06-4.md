description: Spontaneous fermentation is a process that depends on substrates' physical
  characteristics, crop variety, and postharvest practices; it induces variations
  in the metabolites that are responsible for the taste, aroma, and quality. Metabolomics
  makes it possible to detect key metabolites using chemometrics and makes it possible
  to establish patterns or identify biomarker behaviors under certain conditions at
  a given time. Therefore, sensitive and highly efficient analytical techniques allow
