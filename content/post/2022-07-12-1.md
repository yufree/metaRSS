description: This study aimed to determine the changes of lipidome in obese women
  undergoing combined physical exercise training. Fourteen adult women with obesity
  (mean BMI and age, 33 kg/m² and 34 ± 5 years), were submitted to combined physical
  training (aerobic and strength exercises, alternately, 55 min at 75-90% of the maximum
  heart rate, 3 times a week) for 8 weeks. All participants were evaluated before
  and after the training intervention for lipidome, anthropometric measurements, muscle
  strength, ...
