description: During lymphocyte maturation and differentiation, cells undergo a series
  of proliferative stages interrupted with stages of low activity. The rapid proliferation
  stages are marked by changes in metabolic outputs-adapting to energy demands by
  either hindering or utilizing metabolic pathways. As such, it is necessary to view
  these changes in real time; however, current strategies for metabolomics are time
  consuming and very rarely provide a holistic profile of the cellular metabolism
