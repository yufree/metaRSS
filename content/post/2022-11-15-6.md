description: Biochemical investigations were carried out on the embalmed head of Nebiri
  (Museo Egizio, Turin; S-5109)-an 18th Dynasty Ancient Egyptian dignitary-and on
  the canopic jar containing his lungs (Museo Egizio, Turin; S. 5111/02) with the
  aim of characterizing the organ's (lung) specific paleo-proteins and of identifying
  the compounds used in his embalming "recipe". The application of a functionalized
  film method allowed us to perform a non-invasive sampling. Paleo-proteomics confirmed
