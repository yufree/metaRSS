description: Abiotic stresses rewire plant central metabolism to maintain metabolic
  and energy homeostasis. Metabolites involved in the plant central metabolic network
  serve as a hub for regulating carbon and energy metabolism under various stress
  conditions. In this review, we introduce recent metabolomics techniques used to
  investigate the dynamics of metabolic responses to abiotic stresses and analyze
  the trend of publications in this field. We provide an updated overview of the changing
