description: The effect of temperature and light intensity on the polar lipidome of
  endophytic brown algae Streblonema corymbiferum and Streblonema sp. in vitro was
  investigated. More than 460 molecular species have been identified in four glycoglycerolipids
  classes, five phosphoglycerolipids classes and one betaine lipid class. The lipids
  glucuronosyldiacylglycerol and diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethyl-homoserine were found
  in the algae of the order Ectocarpales for the first time. A decrease in ...
