description: The growth of endophytic bacteria is influenced by the host plants and
  their secondary metabolites and activities. In this study, P. megaterium P-NA14
  and P. megaterium D-HT207 were isolated from potato tuber and dendrobium stem respectively.
  They were both identified as Priestia megaterium. The antimicrobial activities and
  metabolites of both strains were explored. For antimicrobial activities, results
  showed that P. megaterium P-NA14 exhibited a stronger inhibition effect on the pathogen
