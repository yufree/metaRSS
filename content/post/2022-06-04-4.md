description: Various studies have identified the kidney as a target organ for patulin
  (PAT)-induced toxicity. However, detailed mechanistic insights into PAT-induced
  nephrotoxicity had not yet been done. Therefore, along with classical toxicological
  parameters, liquid chromatography-high resolution massed spectrometry (LC-HRMS)
  based metabolomics has been carried out to delineate the mechanism(s) of PAT-induced
  nephrotoxicity.An in vivo study was conducted using male Wistar rats, divided into
