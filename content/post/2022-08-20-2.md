description: Hyperuricemia (HUA) seriously harms human health but the exact etiology
  and pathogenesis of HUA are not fully understood. Therefore, it is still of great
  significance to find effective biomarkers and explore the pathogenesis of HUA. Metabolomics
  reflects the influence of internal and external factors on system metabolism, explains
  the changes in metabolite levels during the development of diseases, and reveals
  the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis. Metabolomics is divided into ...
