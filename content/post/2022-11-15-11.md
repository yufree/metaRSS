description: Autophagy is involved in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and
  the removal of damaged proteins and organelles and is necessary to maintain cell
  metabolism in conditions of energy and nutrient deficiency. A decrease in autophagic
  activity plays an important role in age-related diseases. However, the metabolic
  response to autophagy modulation remains poorly understood. Here, we for the first
  time explored the effects of (1) autophagy activation by 48 h fasting, (2) inhibition
