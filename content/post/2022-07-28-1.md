description: Advances in analytical methodologies, including those coupled with mass
  spectrometry (gas chromatography and liquid chromatography; GC-MS and LC-MS) have
  facilitated profiling of carotenoids in complex plant extracts. The combination
  of metabolomic data together with diverse germplasm resources provides a means to
  discover the underlying genetic factors responsible for modulating the carotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway. Here we summarize metabolomics methodologies for large-scale
  metabolite ...
