description: To study the effect of mineral Chloriti Lapis on pulmonary metabolites
  and metabolic pathways in lung tissues of rats with acute exacerbation of chronic
  obstructive pulmonary disease(AECOPD). The AECOPD rat model of phlegm heat syndrome
  was replicated by the method of smoking combined with Klebsiella pneumoniae infection.
  Except for using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis, SPSS 18.0, SIMCA 13.0 and other software
  were also used for statistical analysis. Through literature search and online ...
