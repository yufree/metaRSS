description: Pooled quality controls (QCs) are usually implemented within untargeted
  methods to improve the quality of datasets by removing features either not detected
  or not reproducible. However, this approach can be limiting in exposomics studies
  conducted on groups of exposed and nonexposed subjects, as compounds present at
  low levels only in exposed subjects can be diluted and thus not detected in the
  pooled QC. The aim of this work is to develop and apply an untargeted workflow for
