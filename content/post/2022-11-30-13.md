description: Kidney biopsy is commonly used to diagnose kidney transplant dysfunction
  after transplantation. Therefore, the development of minimally invasive and quantitative
  methods to evaluate kidney function in transplant recipients is necessary. Here,
  we used capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry to analyze the biofluids collected
  from transplant recipients with impaired (Group I, n = 31) and stable (Group S,
  n = 19) kidney function and from donors (Group D, n = 9). Metabolomics analyses
