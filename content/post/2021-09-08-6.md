description: Mushroom, as a kind of higher fungus, is a precious homology resource
  of medicine and foods. In this study, total lipids were extracted from eight wild
  edible mushrooms and subsequently characterized by ultra-high-performance liquid
  chromatography-Quadrupole-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry. 20 lipid classes
  and 173 molecular species were identified and quantified. Lipid molecules and their
  concentrations in Boletus speciosus, Boletus bainiugan, and Tricholoma matsutake
