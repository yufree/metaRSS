description: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by cells and can be found in
  biological fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and milk). EV
  isolation needs to be optimized carefully depending on the type of biofluid and
  tissue. Human milk (HM) is known to be a rich source of EVs, and they are thought
  to be partially responsible for the benefits associated with breastfeeding. Here,
  a workflow for the isolation and lipidomic analysis of HM-EVs is described. The
