description: The consumption of diets rich in saturated fats is known to be associated
  with higher mortality. The adoption of healthy habits, for instance adhering to
  a Mediterranean diet, has proved to exert a preventive effect towards cardiovascular
  diseases and dyslipidemia. Little is known about how a suboptimal diet can affect
  brain function, structure, and the mechanisms involved. The aims of this study were
  to examine how a high-fat diet can alter the brain N-glycan and lipid profile in
