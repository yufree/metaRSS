description: Staphylococcus aureus possesses an extraordinary ability to deal with
  a wide range of osmotic pressure. This study performed transcriptomic and metabolomic
  analyses on the potential mechanism of gradient salinity stress adaptation in S.
  aureus ZS01. The results revealed that CPS biosynthetic protein genes were candidate
  target genes for directly regulating the phenotypic changes of biofilm. Inositol
  phosphate metabolism was downregulated to reduce the conversion of functional molecules.
