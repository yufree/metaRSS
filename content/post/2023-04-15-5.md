description: Despite the importance of hypercholesterolemia in children, it is overlooked,
  and there are currently few metabolomics-based approaches available to understand
  its molecular mechanisms. Children from a birth cohort had their cholesterol levels
  measured with the aim of identifying the metabolites for the molecular biological
  pathways of childhood hypercholesterolemia. One hundred and twenty-five children
  were enrolled and stratified into three groups according to cholesterol levels ...
