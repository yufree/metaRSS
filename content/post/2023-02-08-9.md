description: Tartary buckwheat (TB) sprout is a kind of novel nutritional vegetable,
  but its consumption was limited by low biomass and thin hypocotyl. The tetraploid
  TB sprouts was considered to be able to solve this issue. However, the nutritional
  quality of tetraploid TB sprouts and differences between conventional (diploid)
  and tetraploid TB sprouts remain unclear. In this study, the morphological traits,
  nutrient compositions and metabolome changes of diploid and tetraploid TB sprouts
  were analyzed. ...
