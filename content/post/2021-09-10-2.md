description: 'CONCLUSIONS: This research was motivated by reproducibility, which has
  proven to be a major obstacle in the use of genomic findings to advance clinical
  practice. In this paper, we developed a data-driven approach to assess the reproducibility
  of MS-Metabolomics data sets. The methods described in this paper are implemented
  in the open-source R package marr, which is freely available from Bioconductor at
