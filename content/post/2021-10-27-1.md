description: Red Clapp's Favorite is the red mutation cultivar of the pear cultivar
  Clapp's Favorite. Fruit color is an important feature of pear fruits, with red skin
  generally attracting consumers. Anthocyanin, chlorophyll, and carotenoids are the
  most important pigments in the color formation of fruits. The red color of pear
  skin is mainly due to the concentration and composition of anthocyanin. Metabolomics
  is an emerging discipline that focuses on the qualitative and quantitative analysis
