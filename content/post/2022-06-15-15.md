description: Metabolomics-based precision medicine is facing several obstacles including
  cross-platform data comparison issue and the lack of metabolome benchmark values
  of healthy population, one of main reasons is the shortage of comprehensive metabolome
  quantitation methods. Here, we developed an alternate reversed-phase liquid chromatography-mass
