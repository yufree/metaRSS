description: Different fatty acid proportions produce potential inflammatory and metabolic
  changes in organisms. However, the evidence for how each fatty acid mediates the
  metabolic pathway, and its lipid stability remains controversial. To resolve this
  controversy, the present study investigated the metabolic effects of cold-pressed
