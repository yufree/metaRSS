description: Metabolomic time course analyses of biofluids are highly relevant for
  clinical diagnostics. However, many sampling methods suffer from unknown sample
  sizes, commonly known as size effects. This prevents absolute quantification of
  biomarkers. Recently, several mathematical post acquisition normalization methods
  have been developed to overcome these problems either by exploiting already known
  pharmacokinetic information or by statistical means. Here we present an improved
