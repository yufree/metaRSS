description: As a high-value processed aquatic product, wet-aged tuna has gradually
  become a popular food, but its lipidomics characteristics during the aging process
  have not been investigated. Herein, the lipidomics phenotypic data of tuna at different
  wet-aging stages were acquired using iKnife rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry,
  in which the dominant lipid components, including fatty acid (FA), phosphatidylcholine
  (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), ...
