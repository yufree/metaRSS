description: It seems to be well received that nonlinear electrospray ionization (ESI)
  distorts the signal distribution in mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, thus leading
  to diminished statistical power for t-test. However, the exact consequence and possible
  solutions to this quantitative issue have not been systematically explored. In this
  work, using a serial diluted urine metabolomics dataset, we demonstrated that over
  80% of the metabolic features present nonlinear ESI response patterns, causing ...
