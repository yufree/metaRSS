description: Utilizing metabolomics technology, this study explored the change of
  fecal endogenous metabolites in Walker-256 rats with malignant ascites after the
  administration with Kansui Radix(KR) stir-fried with vinegar(VKR), sought the potential
  biomarkers in feces which were related to the treatment of malignant ascites by
  VKR and revealed the biological mechanism of water-expelling effect of VKR. Ultra-fast
  liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UFLC-Q-TOF-MS)
  was ...
