description: Proteins are direct products of the genome and metabolites are functional
  products of interactions between the host and other factors such as environment,
  disease state, clinical information, etc. Omics data, including proteins and metabolites,
  are useful in characterizing biological processes underlying COVID-19 along with
  patient data and clinical information, yet few methods are available to effectively
  analyze such diverse and unstructured data. Using an integrated approach that ...
