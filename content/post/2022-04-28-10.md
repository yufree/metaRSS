description: We sought to identify the characteristic metabolite profile of blood
  plasma samples obtained from patients with preeclampsia. Direct high-resolution
  mass spectrometry was used to analyze samples from 79 pregnant women, 34 of whom
  had preeclampsia. We performed a comparative analysis of the metabolite profiles
  and found that they differed between pregnant women with and without preeclampsia.
  Lipids and sugars were identified as components of the metabolite profile that are
  likely to be ...
