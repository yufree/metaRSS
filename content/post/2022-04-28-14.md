description: Advances in sequencing technologies over the past 15 years have led to
  a substantially greater appreciation of the importance of the gut microbiome to
  the health of the host. Recent outcomes indicate that aspects of nutrition, especially
  lipids (exogenous or endogenous), can influence the gut microbiota composition and
  consequently, play an important role in the metabolic health of the host. Thus,
  there is an increasing interest in applying holistic analytical approaches, such
