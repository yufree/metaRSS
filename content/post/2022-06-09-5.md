description: Despite the growing number of the vaccinated population, COVID-19, caused
  by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global
  health burden. Obesity, a metabolic syndrome affecting one-third of the population,
  has proven to be a major risk factor for COVID-19 severe complications. Several
  studies have identified metabolic signatures and disrupted metabolic pathways associated
  with COVID-19, however there are no reports evaluating the role of obesity in ...
