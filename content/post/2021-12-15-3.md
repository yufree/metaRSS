description: The seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris are a rich source of protein consumed
  around the world and are considered as the most important source of proteins and
  antioxidants in the Mexican diet. This work reports on the 1H NMR metabolomics profiling
  of the cultivars Peruano (FPe), Pinto (FPi), Flor de mayo (FM), Negro (FN) and Flor
  de junio (FJ). Total phenolics, total flavonoids and total protein contents were
  determined to complement the nutritional facts in seeds and leaves. According to
