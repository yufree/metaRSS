description: Untargeted metabolomics of blood samples has become widely applied to
  study metabolic alterations underpinning disease and to identify biomarkers. However,
  understanding the relevance of a blood metabolite marker can be challenging if it
  is unknown whether it reflects the concentration in relevant tissues. To explore
  this field, metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of plasma, four sites of adipose
  tissues (ATs) from peripheral or central depot, two sites of muscle tissue, and
  liver tissue from ...
