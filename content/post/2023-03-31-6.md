description: Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful imaging technique
  for the analysis of biological samples, providing valuable insights into the spatial
  distribution and structural characterization of lipids. The advancements in high-resolution
  MSI have made it an indispensable tool for single-cell or subcellular lipidomics.
  By preserving both intracellular and intercellular information, MSI enables a comprehensive
  analysis of lipidomics in individual cells and organelles. This ...
