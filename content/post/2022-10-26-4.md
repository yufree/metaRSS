description: A qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolites was performed
  by metabolomics comparation on the pericarps of four varieties of Zanthoxylum bungeanum
  Maxim. The Zanthoxylum bunganum as scion combined with three rootstock varieties
  of Zanthoxylum piasezkii Maxim (YJ), July Zanthoxylum bunganum Maxim (QJ), and August
  Zanthoxylum bunganum Maxim (BJ), at the same time Zanthoxylum bungeanum seedlings
  breeding were compared as control (MJ). A total of 1429 metabolites were identified
