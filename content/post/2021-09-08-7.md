description: Eicosanoids are oxidized derivatives of 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFAs). In recent years, the role and mechanism of eicosanoids in cardiovascular
  diseases have attracted extensive attention. Substrate PUFAs including arachidonic
  acid are metabolized by cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes,
  or non-enzymatic auto-oxidation. Eicosanoid metabolomics is an effective approach
  to study the complex metabolic network of eicosanoids. In this review, we discussed
