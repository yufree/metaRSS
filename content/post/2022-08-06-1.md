description: The metabolic characteristics of COVID-19 disease are still largely unknown.
  Here, 44 patients with COVID-19 (31 mild COVID-19 patients and 13 severe COVID-19
  patients), 42 healthy controls (HC), and 42 patients with community-acquired pneumonia
  (CAP), were involved in the study to assess their serum metabolomic profiles. We
  used widely targeted metabolomics based on an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem
  mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The differentially expressed metabolites in ...
