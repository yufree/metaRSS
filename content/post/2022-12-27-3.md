description: To elucidate nutritional components in sweet potato cultivars for table
  use and to compare the phytochemicals of cultivars from different countries, 'Kokei
  No. 14' and 'Xinxiang' were selected. The physiological parameters and metabolites
  were determined using the colorimetric method and widely targeted metabolomics,
  respectively. Transcriptomic analysis was performed to explain the mechanism that
  resulted in phytochemical differences. 'Xinxiang' showed higher flavonoid and carotenoid
