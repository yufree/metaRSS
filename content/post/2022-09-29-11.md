description: Metabolites represent the most downstream level of the cellular organization.
  Hence, an in vitro untargeted metabolomics approach is extremely valuable to deepen
  the understanding of how endogenous metabolites in cells are altered under a given
  biological condition. This chapter describes a robust liquid chromatography-high-resolution
  mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics platform applied to cell culture
  extracts. The analytical workflow includes an optimized sample ...
