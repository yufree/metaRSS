description: Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis (PS) are common chronic inflammatory
  dermatoses. Although the differences at the intercellular and intracellular signaling
  level between AD and PS are well described, the resulting differences at the metabolism
  level have not yet been systematically analyzed. We compared the metabolomic profiles
  of the lesional skin, non-lesional skin and blood sera of AD and PS. Skin biopsies
  from 15 patients with AD, 20 patients with PS and 17 controls were collected, ...
