description: The short term micro-flowing purification system (STMFPS) has been shown
  to improve the flesh quality of freshwater fish. However, few studies have focused
  on the involved underlying mechanisms. This study explored the effect of STMFPS
  on the flesh quality of market-size freshwater fish based on the combination of
  metabolomics and transcriptomics methods. The UPLC-QTOF/MS based metabolomics method
  was utilized to screen metabolites and predict the possible major metabolic pathways
