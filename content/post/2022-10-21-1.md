description: Several areas such as microbiology, botany, and medicine use genetic
  information and computational tools to organize, classify and analyze data. However,
  only recently has it been possible to obtain the chemical ontology of metabolites
  computationally. The systematic classification of metabolites into classes opens
  the way for adapting methods that previously used genetic taxonomy to now accept
  chemical ontology. Community ecology tools are ideal for this adaptation as they
