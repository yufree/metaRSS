description: Prenatal alcohol exposure can produce offspring growth deficits and is
  a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. We used untargeted metabolomics
  to generate mechanistic insight into how alcohol impairs fetal development. In the
  Western Cape Province of South Africa, 52 women between gestational weeks 5-36 (mean
  18.5 ± 6.5) were recruited, and they provided a finger-prick fasting bloodspot that
  underwent mass spectrometry. Metabolomic data were analyzed using partial ...
