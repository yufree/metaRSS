description: 'Despite mare''s milk being highly nutritious and beneficial to human
  health, the effects of different dietary regimens on the lipid profile of mare''s
  milk remain to be completely understood. Herein we employed targeted multiple reaction
  monitoring-based lipidomics with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole
  time-of-flight-mass spectrometry to compare the milk lipid profiles of mares fed:
  pasture grass (P), corn stover and concentrate (H), or cornsilage and concentrate
