description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Serum metabolites relating to glycolysis, fluid balance
  and inflammation were independently associated with both a marker of subclinical
  atherosclerosis and with symptomatic CVD in people with type 2 diabetes. Additional
  investigation is warranted to determine their roles as possible etiological and/or
  predictive biomarkers for atherosclerotic ...'
