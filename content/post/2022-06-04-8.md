description: The purpose of this work was to reveal the relationship between the microbial
  diversity and flavor profiles of traditional dry-cured duck from a metabolomic perspective.
  Enterococcus, Psychrobacter, Macrococcus, Salinivbrio, and Staphylococcus were the
  dominant bacterial genera, while Trichophyton, Kurtzmaniella, Blumeria, Cladosporium,
  Lysurus, Aspergillus, Starmerella and Debaryomyces were the dominant fungal genera
  of dry-cured duck. The results showed that aldehydes, alcohols, furan, ...
