description: Pseudomonas lundensis and Brochothrix thermosphacta are key spoilage
  microorganisms in aerobically stored chilled meat. The present study aimed to investigate
  the physicochemical and metabolomic profiles of refrigerated ground beef inoculated
  P. lundensis (PL) and B. thermosphacta (BT) as mono- or co-culture (BP). P. lundensis
  was the dominant spoilage strain in the co-culture of ground beef. A large amount
  of TCA-soluble peptide, TVB-N and TBA were formed in the PL and BP, while acetion
