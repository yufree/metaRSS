  of lipid metabolism and identify genetic variants associated with lipid species
  putatively in the mechanistic pathway for coronary artery disease (CAD). We quantified
  596 lipid species in serum from 4,492 individuals from the Busselton Health Study.
  The discovery GWAS identified 3,361 independent lipid-loci associations, involving
