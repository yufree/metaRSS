description: Cryptochrome is the earliest discovered photoreceptor protein in organisms.
  However, the effect of CRY (BmCRY), the clock protein in Bombyx mori, on the body
  or cell metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we continuously interfered with
  the expression of the BmCry1 gene (Cry1-KD) in the silkworm ovary cell line (BmN),
  and the BmN cells developed abnormally, with accelerated cell growth and a smaller
  nucleus. Metabolomics was used to identify the cause of the abnormal development
