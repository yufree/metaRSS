description: Suanzaoren Decoction(SZRD) is a classical formula for the clinical treatment
  of insomnia. This study analyzed the effect of SZRD on endogenous metabolites in
  insomnia rats based on metabonomics and thereby explored the anti-insomnia mechanism
  of SZRD. To be specific, DL-4-chlorophenylalanine(PCPA) was used to induce insomnia
  in rats. Then pathological changes of the liver and brain were observed and biochemical
  indexes such as 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), dopamine(DA), ...
