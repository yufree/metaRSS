description: Buyang-huanwu decoction (BHD) is a classic prescription that has great
  potential to be developed into antifatigue functional food. It may activate blood
  circulation to relieve fatigue in some clinical cases by unclear mechanisms. In
  this study, a metabolomics approach was conducted to investigate the antifatigue
  mechanism of BHD. The murine fatigue model was established in rats by endurance
  swimming, and hemorheology, blood biochemistry, and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass...
