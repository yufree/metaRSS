description: Fever is caused by an increase in the heat production process when the
  body is under the action of a heat source or the dysfunction of the temperature
  center. Ellagic acid (EA) is a polyphenol dilactone that has anti-inflammatory,
  anti-tumor, and antioxidant activities. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected yeast
  to reproduce an experimental fever model (150 ± 20 g), and the rectal temperature
  and its change values were subsequently taken 19 h later; the excessive production
