description: As a medicinal and edible homologous fungi, Morchella is rich in multiple
  metabolites. The metabolite is a kind of essential substance with active components.
  In this study, Morchella fruit bodies and mycelium were selected to identify their
  metabolite components. The primary metabolites of the two experimental groups were
  analyzed using a method of widely targeted metabolome based on UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. A
  total of 354 different metabolites were characterized, including 188 upregulated
  ones and ...
