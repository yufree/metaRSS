description: The discovery of a large number of small pulmonary nodules and early
  diagnosis of lung cancer in the diabetic patients prompt us to re-examine the relationship
  between diabetes and the occurrence and development of lung cancer. The aim of this
  study was to explore the underlying metabolites changes in diabetes with NSCLC or
  benign nodule patients, and further to investigate the association of serum IGF-1
  level and differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs). An untargeted metabolomics
  method ...
