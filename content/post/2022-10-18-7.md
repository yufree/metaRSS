description: Lipidic metabolites play essential roles in host physiological health
  and growth performance, serving as the major structural and signaling components
  of membranes, energy storage molecules, and steroid hormones. Bamboo, as wild giant
  pandas' exclusive diet, is the main determinant of giant pandas' lipidome, both
  as a direct source and through microbiota activity. Interestingly, the consumption
  of bamboo has attracted little attention from a lipidomic perspective. In the current
  study, ...
