description: Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a urease-producing bacteria which
  is a major cause of magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) urolithiasis in canine. A
  positive urolith culture is an important risk factor for MAP urolithiasis in canine.
  The mechanism underlying the metabolic changes of S. pseudintermedius after crystallization
  in artificial urine (AU) needs more defined baseline metabolic information. Therefore,
  we extensively investigated the metabolic changes of S. pseudintermedius ...
