description: Panax ginseng (P. ginseng), the dried root and rhizome of P. ginseng
  C. A. Meyer, is widely used in many fields as dietary supplements and medicine.
  To characterize the chemical constituents in P. ginseng cultivated in different
  growth environments, a UPLC-TOF-MS method was established for qualitative analysis.
  Four hundred and eight ginsenosides, including 81 new compounds, were characterized
  in P. ginseng from different regions. Among the detected compounds, 361 ginsenosides
  were recognized ...
