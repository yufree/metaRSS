description: Silver nanomaterials (AgNMs) are broadly used and among the most studied
  nanomaterials. The underlying molecular mechanisms (e.g. protein and metabolite
  response) that precede phenotypical effects have been assessed to a much lesser
  extent. In this paper, we assess differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and metabolites
  (DEMs) by high-throughput (HTP) techniques (HPLC-MS/MS with tandem mass tags, reversed-phase
  (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) with ...
