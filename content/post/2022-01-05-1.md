description: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common childhood malignancy.
  Rhabdomyosarcoma, on the other hand, is a rare type of malignancy which belongs
  to the primitive neuroectodermal family of tumors. The aim of the present study
  was to use computational methods in order to examine the similarities and differences
  of the two different tumors using two cell lines as a model, the T-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia CCRF-CEM and rhabdomyosarcoma TE-671, and, in particular, similarities
  of ...
