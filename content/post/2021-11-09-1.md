description: In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole
  time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS)-based liver metabolomics
  approach was used to explore the mechanism of &quot;Trichosanthis Fructus-Allii
  Macrostemonis Bulbus&quot; in improving atherosclerosis(AS) of mice with apolipoprotein
  E gene knockout(ApoE~(-/-)). AS mouse model was induced by high-fat diet. The pathological
  and biochemical indexes such as the histopathological changes, body weight, ...
