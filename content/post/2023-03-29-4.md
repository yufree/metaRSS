description: 'CONCLUSION: Sebum has a huge potential beyond skin research and understanding
  how one''s physiological state affects or reflects on the skin metabolome via the
  sebaceous glands itself or by interactions with sebaceous secretion, will open doors
  for simpler biomonitoring. Sebum acts as a sink to environmental metabolites and
  has applications awaiting to be explored, such as biosecurity, cross-border migration,
  localised exposure to harmful substances, and high-throughput population ...'
