description: The present study analyzed the potential biomarkers of chronic obstructive
  pulmonary disease(COPD) with lung-Qi deficiency syndrome by non-targeted metabolomics
  and explored the biological basis of this syndrome. Blood samples of 96 COPD patients
  with lung-Qi deficiency syndrome(COPD with lung-Qi deficiency syndrome group) and
  106 healthy people(healthy control group) were collected, and the metabolic profiles
  of both groups were analyzed by ultra-high performance ...
