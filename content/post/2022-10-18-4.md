description: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) continues to pose a serious threat to
  the cattle industry, resulting in substantial economic losses. As a multifactorial
  disease, pathogen infection and respiratory microbial imbalance are important causative
  factors in the occurrence and development of BRD. Integrative analyses of 16S rRNA
  sequencing and metabolomics allow comprehensive identification of the changes in
  microbiota and metabolism associated with BRD, making it possible to determine which
