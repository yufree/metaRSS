description: Although gut microbiota has been linked to cancer, little is known about
  the crosstalk between gut- and intratumoral-microbiomes. The goal of this study
  was to determine whether gut Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) is involved in the regulation
  of intratumoral microbiome and metabolic contexture, leading to an anticancer effect
  on lung cancer. We evaluated the effects of gut endogenous or gavaged exogenous
  Akk on the tumorigenesis using the Lewis lung cancer mouse model. Feces, blood,
  and ...
