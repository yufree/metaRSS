description: Saliva is a readily accessible and clinically useful biofluid that can
  be used to develop disease biomarkers because of a variety of biologically active
  molecules in it that are also found in blood. However, even though saliva sampling
  is simple and non-invasive, few studies have investigated the use of salivary lipids
  as biomarkers, and the extraction of lipids from saliva needs to be examined thoroughly.
  In the present study, methods (i.e., saliva sample volume, 0.1-1.0 mL) for the ...
