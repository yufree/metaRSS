description: Respiratory allergies affect humans worldwide, causing extensive morbidity
  and mortality. They include allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma, pollen food allergy
  syndrome (PFAS), aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and nasal polyps
  (NPs). The study of respiratory allergic diseases requires new technologies for
  early and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Omics technologies provide the tools
