description: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease mainly
  mediated by mast cells. Lipids exert essential functions in biological processes;
  however, the role of lipids in CU remains unclear. Nontargeted lipidomics was performed
  to investigate the differential lipid profiles between CU patients and healthy control
  (HC) subjects. Functional validation studies were performed in vitro and in vivo
  including β-hexosaminidase release examination from mast cells and passive ...
