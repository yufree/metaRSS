description: Platycodon root, a medicinal food homology species which has been used
  in Asian countries for hundreds of years, is now widely cultivated in China. Treatment
  with paclobutrazol, a typical plant growth retardant, has raised uncertainties regarding
  the quality of Platycodon root, which have been rarely investigated. In the present
  study, metabolomic and lipidomic differences were revealed by ultra-high performance
  liquid chromatography coupled to ion mobility-quadrupole time of flight ...
