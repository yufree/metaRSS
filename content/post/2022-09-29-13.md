description: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) allows for visualization of the spatial
  distribution of proteins, lipids, and other metabolites in a targeted or untargeted
  approach. The identification of compounds through mass spectrometry combined with
  the mapping of compound distribution in the sample establishes IMS as a powerful
  tool for metabolomics. IMS analysis for serotonin will allow researchers to pinpoint
  areas of deficiencies or accumulations associated with ocular disorders such as
