description: While coffee beans have been studied for many years, researchers are
  showing a growing interest in coffee leaves and by-products, but little information
  is currently available on coffee species other than Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora.
  The aim of this work was to perform a targeted and untargeted metabolomics study
  on Coffea arabica, Coffea canephora and Coffea anthonyi. The application of the
  recent high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics tools allowed us to
