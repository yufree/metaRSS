description: S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) are important
  metabolites in the one-carbon cycle that modulates cellular methylation required
  for proliferation and epigenetic regulation. Their concentrations, synthesis, and
  turnover are difficult to determine conveniently and reliably. We have developed
  such a method by coupling a simple and rapid purification scheme that efficiently
  captures both compounds, with high sensitivity, sample throughput direct infusion
