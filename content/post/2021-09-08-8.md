description: The article aims to study the effect and mechanism of shear stress on
  eicosanoids produced by the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids in endothelial
  cells. First, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated by control (Static),
  laminar shear stress (LSS) and oscillatory shear stress (OSS) for 6 h. Then the
  endothelial cells were incubated with fresh M199 medium for 3 h, and the cell culture
  medium was collected. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer
  was used ...
