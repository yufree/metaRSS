description: Most osteoporosis (OP) fracture accidents in men are due not only to
  a low BMD but also because of unhealthy muscle support. However, there has been
  a limited number of reports about how muscle metabolism is disturbed by OP in males.
  In this work, a pathway analysis based on metabolomic research was carried out to
  fill this gap. A classical orchiectomy procedure was adapted to create an OP animal
  model. A micro-CT and pathological section were applied for a bone and muscle phenotype
