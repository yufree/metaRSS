description: Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is an important multipurpose crop grown worldwide,
  but like many other crops, it is often threatened by insect pests. Sugarcane aphid
  (SCA, Melanaphis sacchari Zehntner), for example, is one of the most severe pests
  in sorghum, which causes plant damage and yield loss. The main objective of this
  study was to assess the effect of phytohormones on host plant resistance to aphid
  attack. Two sorghum genotypes, BTx623 (susceptible) and Tx2783 (resistant), were
  selected for ...
