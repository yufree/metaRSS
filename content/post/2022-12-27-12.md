description: The geomagnetic field (GMF) is a natural component of Earth's biosphere.
  GMF reduction to near-null values (NNMF) induces gene expression modulation that
  generates biomolecular, morphological, and developmental changes. Here, we evaluate
  the effect of NNMF on gene expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  in time-course experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants exposed to NNMF in a
  triaxial Helmholtz coils system were sampled from 10 min to 96 h to evaluate ...
