description: Besides their proteome, platelets use, in all responses to the environmental
  cues, a huge and diverse family of hydrophobic and amphipathic small molecules involved
  in structural, metabolic and signaling functions; the lipids. Studying how platelet
  lipidome changes modulate platelet function is an old story constantly renewed through
  the impressive technical advances allowing the discovery of new lipids, functions
  and metabolic pathways. Technical progress in analytical lipidomic profiling ...
