description: Lipidomics has shaped our knowledge of how lipids play a central role
  in cardiovascular diseases (CVD), whereas there is a lack of a summary of existing
  research findings. This study performed a bibliometric analysis of lipidomics research
  in cardiovascular medicine to reveal the core countries, institutions, key researchers,
  important references, major journals, research hotspots and frontiers in this field.
  From 2012 to 2021, a total of 761 articles were obtained from the Web of Science
