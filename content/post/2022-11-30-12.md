description: Fatty acid oxidation disorders (FAODs) are inborn errors of metabolism
  (IEMs) caused by defects in the fatty acid (FA) mitochondrial β-oxidation. The most
  common FAODs are characterized by the accumulation of medium-chain FAs and long-chain
  (3-hydroxy) FAs (and their carnitine derivatives), respectively. These deregulations
  are associated with lipotoxicity which affects several organs and potentially leads
  to life-threatening complications and comorbidities. Changes in the lipidome have
