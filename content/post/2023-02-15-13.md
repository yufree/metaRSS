description: Large-scale high throughput metabolomic technologies are indispensable
  components of systems biology in terms of discovering and defining the metabolite
  parts of the system. However, the lack of a plant metabolite spectral library limits
  the metabolite identification of plant metabolomic studies. Here, we have created
  a plant metabolite spectral library using 544 authentic standards, which increased
  the efficiency of identification for untargeted metabolomic studies. The process
