description: The development of a semi-automated and rapid analytical technique for
  dermatological analysis has become a key aim of many medical and commercial entities
  through greater awareness of people to skin health and its importance in the 21st
  century. We present a proof-of-concept methodology demonstrating the use of validated
  non-destructive, in-situ (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) NMR techniques
  for characterisation and quantitation of (Natural Moisturising Factor) NMF compounds
