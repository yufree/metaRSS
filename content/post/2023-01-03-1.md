description: The combined use of multiple omics allows to study complex interrelated
  biological processes in their entirety. We applied a combination of metabolomics,
  lipidomics and proteomics to human bones to investigate their combined potential
  to estimate time elapsed since death (i.e., the postmortem interval [PMI]). This
  'ForensOMICS' approach has the potential to improve accuracy and precision of PMI
  estimation of skeletonized human remains, thereby helping forensic investigators
  to establish ...
