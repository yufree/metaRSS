description: Toxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic protozoan parasite known to affect
  the human brain. The infection has been associated with an increased incidence of
  schizophrenia; however, the link between the two conditions remains unclear. This
  study aimed to compare the plasma metabolome of schizophrenia and non-schizophrenia
  subjects with or without Toxoplasma infection. Untargeted metabolomic profiling
