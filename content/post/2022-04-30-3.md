description: We describe here a user-friendly analysis protocol for semi-targeted
  polar metabolomics in human muscle biopsies using Zwitterionic Hydrophilic Interaction
  Liquid Chromatography and high-resolution full-scan mass spectrometry. Previously,
  this protocol has been used for Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that it can
  be successfully applied to human muscle biopsies with minor adjustments. Summarized
  instructions for other matrices are also provided. As peak integration in metabolomics
