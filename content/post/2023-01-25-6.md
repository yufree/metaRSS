description: In metabolomics, many metabolites are measured simultaneously in a single
  run. Such analytical performance opens up prospects for clinical laboratory diagnostics.
  In this work, a mass spectrometric metabogram was developed as a simplified and
  clinically applicable way of measuring the blood plasma metabolome. To develop the
  metabogram, blood plasma samples from healthy male volunteers (n = 48) of approximately
  the same age, direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) of the low molecular ...
