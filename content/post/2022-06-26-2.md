description: To understand how the plant regulates metabolism, it is important to
  determine where metabolites localize in the tissues and cells. Single-cell level
  omics approaches in plants have shown remarkable development over the last several
  years, and this data has been instrumental in gene discovery efforts for enzymes
  and transporters involved in metabolism. For metabolomics, Imaging Mass Spectrometry
  (IMS) is a powerful tool to map the spatial distribution of molecules in the tissue.
