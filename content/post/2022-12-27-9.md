description: Administration of systemic retinoids such as acitretin has not been approved
  yet for pediatric patients. An adverse event of retinoid-therapy that occurs with
  lower prevalence in children than in adults is hyperlipidemia. This might be based
  on the lack of comorbidities in young patients, but must not be neglected. Especially
  for the development of the human brain up to young adulthood, dysbalance of lipids
  might be deleterious. Here, we provide for the first time an in-depth analysis of
