description: The experimental evidences linking PM(2.5) exposure to weight status
  disorder and the associated mechanisms were lacked. Here, we demonstrated exposure
  of 198.52 μg/m³ PM(2.5) (Baoji city, China) for 40 days induced body weight loss
  of male Balb/C mice, and then increased after 14-day recovery. Correspondingly,
  gut microbiota dysbiosis, ileum metabolism alterations, and histopathological changes
  of liver and ileum elucidated the underlying mechanism. The richness and function
  modules of flora ...
