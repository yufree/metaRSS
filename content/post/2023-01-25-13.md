description: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common male malignancy and the fifth
  leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide. Prostate cancer cells are characterized
  by a hybrid glycolytic/oxidative phosphorylation phenotype determined by androgen
  receptor signaling. An increased lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis have been described
  in PCa cells. Many studies have shown that enzymes involved in these pathways are
  overexpressed in PCa. Glutamine becomes an essential amino acid for PCa cells, and
