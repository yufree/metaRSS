description: This study compared the physiological effects at a metabolomics level
  with autonomic nervous system responses in adults during soil mixing activities,
  based on the presence or absence of Streptomyces rimosus in the soil. Thirty adult
  participants performed soil mixing activities for 5 min using sterilized soil with
  culture media and Streptomyces rimosus, respectively. Blood samples were drawn twice
  from each participant after each activity. Electroencephalograms were measured during
