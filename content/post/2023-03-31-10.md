description: Ginseng is regarded as the "king of herbs" in China, with its roots and
  rhizomes used as medicine, and it has a high medicinal value. In order to meet the
  market demand, the artificial cultivation of ginseng emerged, but different growth
  environments significantly affect the root morphology of garden ginseng. In this
  study, we used ginseng cultivated in deforested land (CF-CG) and ginseng cultivated
  in farmland (F-CG) as experimental materials. These two phenotypes were explored
