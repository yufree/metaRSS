description: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, leads to symptoms
  ranging from asymptomatic disease to death. Although males are more susceptible
  to severe symptoms and higher mortality due to COVID-19, patient sex has rarely
  been examined. Sex-associated metabolic changes may implicate novel biomarkers and
  therapeutic targets to treat COVID-19. Here, using serum samples, we performed global
  metabolomic analyses of uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-positive male and female patients
  with ...
