description: Lung cancer cells are well documented to rewire their metabolism and
  energy production networks to enable proliferation and survival in a nutrient-poor
  and hypoxic environment. Although metabolite profiling of blood plasma and tissue
  is still emerging in omics approaches, several techniques have shown potential in
  cancer diagnosis. In this paper, the authors describe the alterations in the metabolic
  phenotype of lung cancer patients. In addition, we focus on the metabolic cooperation
