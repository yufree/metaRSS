description: Angelicae Sinensis Radix (AS) is reproted to exert anti-depression effect
  (ADE) and nourishing blood effect (NBE) in a rat model of depression. The correlation
  between the two therapeutic effects and its underlying mechanisms deserves further
  study. The current study is designed to explore the underlying mechanisms of correlation
  between the ADE and NBE of AS based on hepatic metabonomics, network pharmacology
  and molecular docking. According to metabolomics analysis, 30 metabolites involved
