description: Jujube fruit (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is extremely susceptible to mechanical
  injury by extrusion and collision during storage, transportation and processing.
  In this study, we examined the morphology and endogenous metabolism of jujubes at
  three developmental stages after applying partial compression (PC) to mimic mechanical
  injury. Generally, PC did not affect the total soluble solids content, but increased
  the acidity and decreased the amount of phenolics in the jujube fruit. ...
