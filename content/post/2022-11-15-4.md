description: 'Metabolomics is an essential method to study the dynamic changes of
  metabolic networks and products using modern analytical techniques, as well as reveal
  the life phenomena and their inherent laws. Currently, more and more attention has
  been paid to the development of metabolic histochemistry in the fungus field. This
  paper reviews the application of metabolomics in fungal research from five aspects:
  identification, response to stress, metabolite discovery, metabolism engineering,
