description: Oxygen is important for lipid metabolism, being involved in both enzymatic
  transformations and oxidative reactivity, and is particularly influent when genetic
  diseases impair the repair machinery of the cells, such as described for Cockayne
  syndrome (CS). We used two cellular models of transformed fibroblasts defective
