description: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is commonly accompanied by global alterations
  in metabolic profiles, resulting in cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation in
  the brain. Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we performed
  integrative untargeted metabolomic analysis of metabolite alterations in the serum
  and hippocampal tissues of amyloid-β (Aβ)-injected AD model mice and sham controls.
  Multivariate analysis revealed that a Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025 ...
