description: A combination of omics techniques (transcriptomics and metabolomics)
  has been used to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the antitumor action of
  a nanosystem based on a Ag core coated with mesoporous silica on which transferrin
  has been anchored as a targeting ligand against tumor cells (Ag@MSNs-Tf). Transcriptomics
  analysis has been carried out by gene microarrays and RT-qPCR, while high-resolution
  mass spectrometry has been used for metabolomics. This multi-omics strategy has
