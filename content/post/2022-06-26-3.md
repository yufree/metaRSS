description: Enzyme specificity in lipid metabolic pathways often remains unresolved
  at the lipid species level, which is needed to link lipidomic molecular phenotypes
  with their protein counterparts to construct functional pathway maps. We created
  lipidomic profiles of 23 gene knockouts in a proof-of-concept study based on a CRISPR/Cas9
  knockout screen in mammalian cells. This results in a lipidomic resource across
  24 lipid classes. We highlight lipid species phenotypes of multiple knockout cell
