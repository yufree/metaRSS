description: Lipid compositions of cells, tissues, and bio-fluids are complex, with
  varying concentrations and structural diversity making their identification challenging.
  Newer methods for comprehensive analysis of lipids are thus necessary. Herein, we
  propose a targeted-mass spectrometry based lipidomics screening method using a combination
  of variable retention time window and relative dwell time weightage. Using this
  method, we identified more than 1000 lipid species within 24-min. The limit ...
