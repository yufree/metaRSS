description: 'Objective: To investigate the urinary small molecular metabolites and
  their metabolic characteristics of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
  Methods: High throughput ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight
  mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was used to detect the small molecular metabolites
  in urine of healthy control (n=10), patients with hepatic hemangioma (n=10) and
