description: In this study, we identify 11 mouse pup volatiles putatively involved
  in maternal care induction in adult females. For this purpose, we have adapted the
  dynamic headspace methodology to extract the volatolome of whole alive animals.
  Untargeted metabolomic methodology was used to compare the volatolome of neonatal
  (4-6 days) with elder pups until the age of weaning (21-23 days old). Pup volatolome
  was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to single quadrupole mass spectrometry
  (MS) ...
