description: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant form of lung cancer
  and is one of the most fatal cancers worldwide. Recently, the International Association
  for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) proposed a novel grading system based on the
  predominant and high-grade histological patterns for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma
  (IPA). To improve outcomes for NSCLC patients, we combined serum metabolomics and
  fecal microbiology to screen biomarkers in patients with early-stage NSCLC ...
