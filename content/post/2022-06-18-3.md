description: SARS-CoV-2 causes major disturbances in serum metabolite levels, associated
  with severity of the immune response. Despite the numerous advantages of urine for
  biomarker discovery, the potential association between urine metabolites and disease
  severity has not been investigated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a
  proof-of-concept study, we performed quantitative urine metabolomics in patients
  hospitalized with COVID-19 and controls using LC-MS/MS. We assessed whether ...
