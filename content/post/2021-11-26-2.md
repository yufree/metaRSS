description: In recent years, with the rapid development of metabonomic technology
  and analytic methods, metabolomics epidemiology, as an important branch of systems
  epidemiology, attracts more attention. Metabolomics epidemiology can better describe
  the characteristics of exposure, reflect the interaction between environmental factors
  and genetics, uncover the "black box" of the mechanisms underlying exposure and
  disease, and identify new biomarkers. This article briefly introduces the definition,
