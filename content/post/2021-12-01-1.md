description: Altrenogest (ALT), a synthetic progestogen, is used in pig farming for
  estrus synchronization in gilts. Residues of ALT and its metabolites may reach the
  aquatic environment via the spread of liquid manure and may present a risk for fish
  and other higher aquatic organisms due to its endocrine disrupting potential. A
  pilot study was conducted in which spot urine samples from ALT-treated and non-medicated
  gilts were collected. We applied LC-HRMS analysis to perform targeted analysis of
  ALT ...
