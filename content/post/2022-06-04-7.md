description: Leuconostoc mesenteroides are generally recognized as a group of specific
  spoilage organisms in meat and poultry products, which cause acidification and blown
  pack spoilage of meat. In this study, a total of 6 representative strains selected
  from 55 L. mesenteroides isolated from spoiled meat were tested to evaluate the
  spoilage ability by metabonomics and in-situ analysis. The intra-species spoilage
  heterogeneity was observed. The results showed that the acidifying and gas production
