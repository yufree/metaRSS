description: Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is one of the world's most widely
  farmed cold-water fish. However, the rise in water temperature caused by global
  warming has seriously restricted the development of rainbow trout aquaculture. In
  this study, we investigated the physiological responses in the liver of rainbow
  trout exposed to 20 ℃ and 24 ℃ and returning to the initial temperature (14 ℃) by
  combining biochemical analyses and UPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics. The results of the
  biochemical ...
