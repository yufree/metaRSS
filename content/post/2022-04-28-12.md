description: The rapid development of biogas plants in China has generated large quantities
  of digestate. The disparity between the continuity of biogas plant operation and
  the seasonality of digestate utilization has led to the need to store digestate.
  Therefore, untargeted profiling of bioactive compounds in the digestate stored under
  aerobic and anaerobic conditions was performed. The antioxidant and antifungal activity
  of digestate stored under varying conditions was likewise assessed. The ...
