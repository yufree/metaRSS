description: Previously, we reported the development of novel small molecules that
  are potent inhibitors of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) of Trypanosoma
  brucei and related protists responsible for serious diseases in humans and domestic
  animals. Cultured bloodstream-form trypanosomes, which are fully reliant on glycolysis
  for their ATP production, are rapidly killed at submicromolar concentrations of
  these compounds, which have no effect on the activity of human PFKs and human ...
