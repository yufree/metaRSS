description: 'CONCLUSION: Beta cell proliferation and function are elevated during
  pregnancy, and this is coupled to the enrichment of islet metabolites and metabolic
  pathways primarily associated with amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism.
  This study provides insight into metabolic adaptive changes in glucose homeostasis
  and islet function seen during pregnancy, which will provide a molecular rationale
  to further explore the regulation of maternal metabolism to avoid the onset of pregnancy
