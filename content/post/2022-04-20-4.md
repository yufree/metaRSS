description: In vivo and in vitro anti-allergic activities of ethanol extract of Xenostegia
  tridentata (L.) D.F. Austin & Staples were investigated using passive cutaneous
  anaphylaxis reaction assay and RBL-2H3 cell degranulation assay, respectively. The
  crude ethanol extract exhibited promising activities when compared with the known
