description: Food waste, as a major part of municipal solid waste, has been increasingly
  generated worldwide. Efficient and feasible utilization of this waste material for
  biomanufacturing is crucial to improving economic and environmental sustainability.
  In the present study, black soldier flies (BSF) larvae were used as carriers to
  treat and upcycle food waste. Larvae of the BSF were incubated with UV light for
  10, 20, and 30 min at a wavelength of 257.3 nm and an intensity of 8 W. The food
