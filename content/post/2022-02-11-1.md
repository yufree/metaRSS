description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The differential regulation of plant hormones and the accumulation
  of flavonoids may be important for the seed germination survival of T. hispida in
  response to salt or arid deserts. This study enhanced the understanding of the overall
  mechanism in seed germination and post-germination. The results provide guidance
  for the ecological value and young seedling growth of T. ...'
