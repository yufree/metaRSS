description: Citrus fruits are grown worldwide for their special nutritive and several
  health benefits. Among citrus bioactives, naringenin, a major flavanone, exhibits
  a potential hepatoprotective effect that is not fully elucidated. Herein, serum
  biochemical parameters and histopathological assays were used to estimate the hepatoprotective
  activity of naringenin, isolated from Citrus sinensis (var. Valencia) peels, in
  CCl(4)-induced injury in a rat model. Further, GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics
