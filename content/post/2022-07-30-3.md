description: The rhizomes of Polygonatum sibiricum are commonly consumed as food and
  also used as medicine. However, the metabolic profile of P. sibiricum has not been
  fully revealed yet. Recently, we developed a novel evergreen species of P. sibiricum.
  The objectives of this study were to compare the metabolic profiles of two types
  of P. sibiricum, i.e., the newly developed evergreen type (Gtype) and a wide-type
  (Wtype), by using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach. A
