description: Genes are pleiotropic and getting a better knowledge of their function
  requires a comprehensive characterization of their mutants. Here, we generated multi-level
  data combining phenomic, proteomic and metabolomic acquisitions from plasma and
  liver tissues of two C57BL/6 N mouse models lacking the Lat (linker for activation
  of T cells) and the Mx2 (MX dynamin-like GTPase 2) genes, respectively. Our dataset
  consists of 9 assays (1 preclinical, 2 proteomics and 6 metabolomics) generated
  with ...
