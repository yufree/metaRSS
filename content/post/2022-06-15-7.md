description: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) has always been an important occupational
  hazard, but the exact etiopathogenesis underlying NIHL remains unclear. Herein,
  we aimed to find metabolic biomarkers involved in the development of NIHL based
  on a mouse model using a gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
  metabolomics technique. We showed that the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds
  at the frequencies of 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32 kHz were all significantly elevated
