description: Evidence continues to accrue that aging and its diseases can be delayed
  by pharmacologic and dietary strategies that target the underlying hallmarks of
  the aging process. However, identifying simple, safe, and effective dietary strategies
  involving the incorporation of whole foods that may confer some protection against
  the aging process is also needed. Recent observational studies have suggested that
