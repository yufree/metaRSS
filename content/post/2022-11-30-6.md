description: Metabolomics have been widely used in pregnancy-related diseases. However,
  physiological variations induced by chronic hypoxia during pregnancy are not well
  characterized. We aimed to investigate physiological variations induced by chronic
  hypoxia during pregnancy. A Sprague-Dawley (SD) pregnant rat model of chronic hypoxia
  was established. Plasma and urine metabolite profiles at different stages of the
  pregnancy were detected by ¹H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance). Multivariate ...
