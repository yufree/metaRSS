description: There is a great discrepancy between the natural product output of cultured
  microorganisms and their bioinformatically predicted biosynthetic potential, such
  that most of the molecular diversity contained within microbial reservoirs has yet
  to be discovered. One of the primary reasons is insufficient expression of natural
  product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) under standard laboratory conditions.
  Several methods have been developed to increase production from such "cryptic" BGCs.
