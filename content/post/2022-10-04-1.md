description: A global lipidomic analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
  was performed on the liver of beagle dogs infected with Toxocara canis to profile
  hepatic lipid species at 12 h post-infection (hpi), 24 hpi, and 36 days post-infection
  (dpi). This analysis identified six categories and 42 subclasses of lipids, including
  173, 64, and 116 differentially abundant lipid species at 12 hpi, 24 hpi, and 36
  dpi, respectively. Many of the identified lysophospholipids, such ...
