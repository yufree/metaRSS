description: Metabolomics continues to progress, but obstacles remain. The preservation
  of metabolites in the target tissue and gathering information on the current metabolic
  state of the organism of interest proves challenging. Robustness, reproducibility,
  and reliable quantification are necessary for confident metabolite identification
  and should always be considered for effective biomarker discovery. Recent advancements
