description: Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has been identified as an approach to reduce
  the risk of obesity-related metabolic diseases. We hypothesize that TRF triggers
  a change in nutrient (e.g., dietary fat) absorption due to shortened feeding times,
  which subsequently alters the fecal microbiome and lipidome. In this report, three
  groups of C57BL/6 mice were fed either a control diet with ad libitum feeding (16%
  energy from fat) (CTRL-AL), a high-fat diet (48% energy from fat) with ad libitum
