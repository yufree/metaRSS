description: Ion mobility (IM) adds a new dimension to liquid chromatography-mass
  spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics which significantly enhances coverage,
  sensitivity, and resolving power for analyzing the metabolome, particularly metabolite
  isomers. However, the high dimensionality of IM-resolved metabolomics data presents
  a great challenge to data processing, restricting its widespread applications. Here,
  we develop a mass spectrum-oriented bottom-up assembly algorithm for IM-resolved
