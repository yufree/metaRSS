description: The execution of specific processing protocols endows Wuyi rock tea with
  distinctive qualities produced through signature metabolic processes. In this work,
  tea leaves were collected before and after each of three processing stages for both
  targeted and untargeted metabolomic analysis. Metabolic profiles of processing stages
  through each processing stage of rotation, pan-firing and roasting were studied.
  Overall, 614 metabolites were significantly altered, predominantly through ...
