description: Breast cancer (BC) is the first malignant neoplasm in women, with a high
  death rate despite early diagnoses and treatment advances. Significant differences
  exist between the most common BC and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC
  presents molecular differences such as lacking expression of the estrogen receptor
  (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 proteins, making this cancer have a poor
  clinical prognostic and lack clear strategies for its treatment. However, growing
