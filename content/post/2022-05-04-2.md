description: Analyzing the metabolic dependencies of tumor cells is vital for cancer
  diagnosis and treatment. Here, we describe a protocol for ^(13)C-stable glucose
  and glutamine isotope tracing in mice HER2+ breast cancer brain metastatic lesions.
  We describe how to inject cancer cells intracardially to generate brain metastatic
  lesions in mice. We then detail how to perform ^(13)C-stable isotope infusion in
  mice with established brain metastasis. Finally, we outline steps for sample collection,
