description: The present chapter describes basic aspects of the main steps for data
  processing on mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platforms, focusing on the main
  objectives and important considerations of each step. Initially, an overview of
  metabolomics and the pivotal techniques applied in the field are presented. Important
  features of data acquisition and preprocessing such as data compression, noise filtering,
  and baseline correction are revised focusing on practical aspects. Peak ...
