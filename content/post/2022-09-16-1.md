description: The metabolic changes associated with intrauterine growth restriction
  (IUGR) particularly affect the liver, which is a central metabolic organ and contributes
  significantly to the provision of energy and specific nutrients and metabolites.
  Therefore, our aim was to decipher and elucidate the molecular pathways of developmental
  processes mediated by miRNAs and mRNAs, as well as the metabolome in fetal liver
  tissue in IUGR compared to appropriate for gestational age groups (AGA). ...
