description: 'Abstrct: Metabonomics is a relative discipline that develops after genomics
  and proteomics, and it is an important component of systems biology. It uses high-throughput
  and high-sensitivity instruments to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis
  of all metabolic components in specific biological samples under limited conditions
  and combines with multivariate statistics to analyze and process the data to obtain
  information about physiological, pathological or toxicological changes ...'
