description: Obesity is an epidemic all around the world. Weight loss interventions
  that are effective differ from each other with regard to various lipidomic responses.
  Here, we aimed to find lipidomic biomarkers that are related to beneficial changes
  in weight loss. We adopted an untargeted liquid chromatography with tandem mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to measure 953 lipid species for Exercise (exercise
  intervention cohort, N = 25), 1388 lipid species for LSG (laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
