description: This chapter discusses the fundamentals of gas chromatography (GC) to
  improve method development for metabolic profiling of complex biological samples.
  The selection of column geometry and phase ratio impacts analyte mass transfer,
  which must be carefully optimized for fast analysis. Stationary phase selection
  is critical to obtain baseline resolution of critical pairs, but such selection
  must consider important aspects of metabolomic protocols, such as derivatization
  and dependence of ...
