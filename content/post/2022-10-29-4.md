description: Both the bulbs and flowers of Fritillaria thunbergii Miq. (BFT and FFT)
  are widely applied as expectorants and antitussives in traditional Chinese medicine,
  but few studies have been conducted to compare the chemical compositions of these
  plant parts. In this study, 50% methanol extracts of BFT and FFT were analyzed via
  UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS/MS, and the feasibility of using non-targeted UHPLC-HRMS
