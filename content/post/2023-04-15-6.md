description: '(1) Background: Exercise is effective in promoting and maintaining bone
  mass. The aim of this study was to detect the exercise-induced metabolic changes
  in bone tissue of zebrafish. (2) Methods: Thirty-eight zebrafish (Danio rerio, six
  months old) were analyzed. The exercise group (n = 19) received 8 weeks of counter-current
  swimming training. The control group (n = 19) was not subjected to exercise. Mineralization
  was quantified, and alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and anti-tartrate acid ...'
