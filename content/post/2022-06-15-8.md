description: Poncirin (PC) and its aglycone, isosakuranetin (IR), occur naturally
  in citrus fruits. This study aimed to explore the pathways behind the different
  health benefits of PC and IR by evaluating the effect of these two bioactive flavonoids
  on the gut microbial diversity and metabolomics of mice. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing
  was used to analyze the alteration of gut microbiota in mice after PC and IR intervention.
  The metabolic impact of PC and IR in mice were studied using a metabolomics ...
