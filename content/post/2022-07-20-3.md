description: 'CONCLUSION: The method of using inclusion list comprised of biologically
  relevant lipids in DIA MS/MS scan is as efficient as traditional DDA method in profiling
  lipids, but offers better consistency of lipid identification, compared to DDA method.
  This study was performed using Orbitrap Exploris 480, and we will further evaluate
  this workflow on other platforms, and if verified by future work, this biologically
  relevant ion fragmentation workflow could be routinely used in many studies ...'
