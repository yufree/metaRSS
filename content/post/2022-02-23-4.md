  Spinosae Semen extract in the treatment of insomnia based on serum metabolomics
  and network pharmacology. The rat insomnia model induced by p-chlorophenylalanine(PCPA)
  was established. After oral administration of Ziziphi Spinosae Semen extract, the
  general morphological observation, pentobarbital sodium-induced sleep test, and
  histopathological evaluation were carried out. The potential biomarkers of the extract
