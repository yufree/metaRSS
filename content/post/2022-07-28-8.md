description: Carotenoid biosynthesis has now been subjected to metabolic engineering
  for over two decades. The outputs clearly show that carotenoid formation is an integral
  component of metabolism. Perturbations can affect intermediary metabolism and other
  isoprenoids. The advances in omic technologies have enabled the quantitative assessment
  of changes in the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome in response to altered
  carotenoid biosynthesis. In the present article, the approaches and procedures ...
