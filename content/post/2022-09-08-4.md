description: Patients with type 2 diabetes have twice as much of the risk of acute
  ischemic stroke (AIS) occurrence as healthy individuals, and the AIS patients with
  type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of death and a poorer prognosis. This study was
  to investigate the interrelationship between hyperglycemia and AIS and provided
  a reference for blood glucose management of AIS patients. The blood glucose level
  of AIS patients of the present study was controlled by insulin below 180 mg/dL (standard
  group) ...
