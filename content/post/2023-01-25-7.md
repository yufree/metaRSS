description: Even though the application of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) has significantly
  facilitated the identification of disease-associated mutations, the diagnostic rate
  of rare diseases is still below 50%. This causes a diagnostic odyssey and prevents
  specific treatment, as well as genetic counseling for further family planning. Increasing
  the diagnostic rate and reducing the time to diagnosis in children with unclear
  disease are crucial for a better patient outcome and improvement of quality ...
