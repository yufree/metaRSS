description: The gut microbiome is involved in nutrient metabolism and produces metabolites
  that, via the gut-brain axis, signal to the brain and influence cognition. Human
  studies have so far had limited success in identifying early metabolic alterations
  linked to cognitive aging, likely due to limitations in metabolite coverage or follow-ups.
  Older persons from the Three-City population-based cohort who had not been diagnosed
  with dementia at the time of blood sampling were included, and repeated ...
