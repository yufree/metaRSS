  tract infections are a worldwide health problem for humans and animals. Different
  cell types produce lipid mediators in response to infections, which consist of eicosanoids
  like hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) or oxylipins like hydroxydocosahexaenoic
  acids (HDHAs). Both substance classes possess immunomodulatory functions. However,
  little is known about their role in respiratory infections.</p> </span> <span ...'
