description: Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a common malignancy of the urinary system. The
  gut microbiome produces various metabolites that play functional roles in tumorigenesis
  and tumor progression. However, the integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and
  metabolome in BLCA has still been lacking. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify
  microbial and functional characteristics and metabolites in BLCA in a Chinese population.
  Metagenomics, targeted metabolomics, bioinformatics, and integrative ...
