description: Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture technologies, which more closely
  mimic the complex microenvironment of tissue, are being increasingly evaluated as
  a tool for the preclinical screening of clinically promising new molecules, and
  studying of tissue metabolism. Studies of metabolites released into the extracellular
  space (secretome) allow understanding the metabolic dynamics of tissues and changes
  caused by therapeutic interventions. Although quite advanced in the field of proteomics,
  studies ...
