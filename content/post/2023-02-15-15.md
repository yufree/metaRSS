description: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the method of choice
  for the untargeted profiling of biological samples. A multiplatform LC-MS-based
  approach is needed to screen polar metabolites and lipids comprehensively. Different
  mobile phase modifiers were tested to improve the electrospray ionization process
  during metabolomic and lipidomic profiling. For polar metabolites, hydrophilic interaction
  LC using a mobile phase with 10 mM ammonium formate/0.125% formic acid provided
