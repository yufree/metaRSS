description: In general, food processing and its conditions affect nutrients, bioactive
  compounds, and sensory characteristics of food products. This research aims to use
  a non-targeted metabolomics approach based on UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS to determine how
  fruit processing can affect the metabolic profile of fruits and, through a comprehensive
  metabolic analysis, identify possible markers to assess their degree of processing.
  The present study uses a real case from the food industry to evaluate markers of
