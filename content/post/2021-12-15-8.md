description: This study investigated the association between COVID-19 infection and
  host metabolic signatures as prognostic markers for disease severity and mortality.
  We enrolled 82 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection who were classified
  as mild, moderate, or severe/critical based upon their WHO clinical severity score
  and compared their results with 31 healthy volunteers. Data on demographics, comorbidities
  and clinical/laboratory characteristics were obtained from medical records. ...
