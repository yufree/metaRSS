description: Canine pyometra frequently occurs in middle-aged to older intact bitches,
  which seriously affects the life of dogs and brings an economic loss to their owners.
  Hence, finding a key metabolite is very important for the diagnosis and development
  of a new safe and effective therapy for the disease. In this study, dogs with pyometra
  were identified by blood examinations, laboratory analyses and diagnostic imaging,
  and fifteen endometrium tissues of sick dogs with pyometra and fifteen controls
