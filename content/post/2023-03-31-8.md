description: Alzheimer's disease poses a global health concern with unmet demand requiring
  creative approaches to discover new medications. In this study, we investigated
  the chemical composition and the anticholinesterase activity of Aspergillus niveus
  Fv-er401 isolated from Foeniculum vulgare (Apiaceae) roots. Fifty-eight metabolites
  were identified using UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of the crude extract. The fungal extract
