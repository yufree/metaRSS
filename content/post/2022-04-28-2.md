description: 'The aim of this study was to compare changes in the metabolite levels
  of ex-smokers and nonsmokers using a metabolomics approach, accounting for the weight
  gain in ex-smokers. Volunteer ex-smokers and nonsmokers were recruited from two
  cohorts Shijingshan (174) and Xishan (78), respectively, at a 1 : 1 ratio for age
  and sex. Nontargeted metabolomics was performed on the volunteers'' blood samples
  using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and multivariate statistical analysis
