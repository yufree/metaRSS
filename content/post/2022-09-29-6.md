description: Plants produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites in the process
  of evolution. Secondary metabolites have highly diverse structures due to the modification
  of the basic skeletons of metabolites. They are required for interaction with the
  environment and are produced in response to abiotic/biotic stress. Characterization
  of secondary metabolic pathways is significant to plant molecular breeding and natural
  product biosynthesis. The liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem ...
