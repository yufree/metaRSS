description: Skeletal muscle myofibers are heterogeneous in their metabolism. However,
  metabolomic profiling of single myofibers has remained difficult. Mass spectrometry
  imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool for imaging molecular distributions. In this work,
  we optimized the workflow of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-based
  MSI from cryosectioning to metabolomics data analysis to perform high-spatial resolution
  metabolomic profiling of slow- and fast-twitch myofibers. Combining the ...
