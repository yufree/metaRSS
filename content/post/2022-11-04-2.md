description: The unravelling of the complexity of cellular metabolism is in its infancy.
  Cancer-associated genetic alterations may result in changes to cellular metabolism
  that aid in understanding phenotypic changes, reveal detectable metabolic signatures,
  or elucidate vulnerabilities to particular drugs. To understand cancer-associated
  metabolic transformation, we performed untargeted metabolite analysis of 173 different
  cancer cell lines from 11 different tissues under constant conditions for ...
