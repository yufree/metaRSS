description: Inborn errors of metabolism, also known as inherited metabolic diseases
  (IMDs), are related to genetic mutations and cause corresponding biochemical metabolic
  disorder of newborns and even sudden infant death. Timely detection and diagnosis
  of IMDs are of great significance for improving survival of newborns. Here we propose
  a strategy for simultaneously detecting six types of IMDs via combining GC-MS technique
  with the random forest algorithm (RF). Clinical urine samples from IMD and ...
