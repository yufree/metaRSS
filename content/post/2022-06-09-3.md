description: Psychotic disorders are currently diagnosed by examining the patient's
  mental state and medical history. Identifying reliable diagnostic, monitoring, predictive,
  or prognostic biomarkers would be useful in clinical settings and help to understand
  the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Here, we performed an untargeted metabolomics
  analysis using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight
  mass spectroscopy on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples of 25 patients
