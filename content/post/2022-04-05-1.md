description: 'CONCLUSIONS: CCYV infection repressed the defensive flavonoids, terpeneoids
  metabolism but triggered the lipids, amino acids and nucleotides metabolism with
  the inoculation period. This result suggests that CCYV-infection makes cucumber
  plants more susceptible for whiteflies attack and CCYV infection. The reduction
  of defensive comounds and the increase of amino acids may be partially responsible
  for enhancing feeding preference of whiteflies to CCYV-infected hosts. CCYV may
