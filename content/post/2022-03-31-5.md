description: The fast-growing food industry is bringing significant number of new
  products to the market. To protect consumers' health and rights, it is crucial that
  food control laboratories are able to ensure reliable quality testing, including
  product authentication and detection of adulterations. In our study, we applied
  a fast and eco-friendly method based on shotgun-lipidomic mass spectrometry for
  the authentication of niche edible oils. Comprehensive lipid profiles of camelina
