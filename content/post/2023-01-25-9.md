description: Skin cancer, including malignant melanoma (MM) and keratinocyte carcinoma
  (KC), historically named non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), represents the most common
  type of cancer among the white skin population. Despite decades of clinical research,
  the incidence rate of melanoma is increasing globally. Therefore, a better understanding
  of disease pathogenesis and resistance mechanisms is considered vital to accomplish
  early diagnosis and satisfactory control. The "Omics" field has recently ...
