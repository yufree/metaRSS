description: Dimensionality reduction approaches are commonly used for the deconvolution
  of high-dimensional metabolomics datasets into underlying core metabolic processes.
  However, current state-of-the-art methods are widely incapable of detecting nonlinearities
  in metabolomics data. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep learning method
  designed to learn nonlinear latent representations which generalize to unseen data.
  Here, we trained a VAE on a large-scale metabolomics population cohort of ...
