description: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by the development
  of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during the second or third trimester of
  pregnancy, associated with considerable risks to both the mother and developing
  fetus. Although emerging evidence suggests an association between the altered gut
  microbiota and GDM, remarkably little is known about the microbial and metabolic
  mechanisms that link the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota to the development of GDM.
