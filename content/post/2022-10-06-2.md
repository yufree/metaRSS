description: Ampelopsis grossedentata is a traditional medicinal and edible plant
  rich in bioactive compounds. This paper focus on the white powder on the surface
  of A. grossedentata, and the effects of processing technology and storage time on
  the composition of bioactive compounds in Ampelopsis grossedentata extracts (AMP).
  33 compounds in AMP were identified and 30 compounds were reported for the first
  time compared with standards by UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS. Organic acid, phenol, and flavonoids
  were ...
