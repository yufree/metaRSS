description: High quality and nutritional benefits are ultimately the desirable features
  that influence the commercial value and market share of broad bean (Vicia faba L.).
  Different cultivars vary greatly in taste, flavor, and nutrition. However, the molecular
  basis of these traits remains largely unknown. Here, the grain metabolites of the
  superior Chinese landrace Cixidabaican (CX) were detected by a widely targeted metabolomics
  approach and compared with the main cultivar Lingxiyicun (LX) from Japan. ...
