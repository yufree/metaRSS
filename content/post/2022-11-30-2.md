description: Foods contain not only nutrients but also a wide variety of components
  related to flavor and functionality. Many studies have been conducted on the components
  of foods. Quantitative analysis has been used to assess compounds in food such as
  sugars, amino acids, and organic acids for food flavor; carotenoids and anthocyanins
  for appearance and color; and vitamins related to functionality for human health.
  Plants and animals that are food materials are thought to contain hundreds to thousands
