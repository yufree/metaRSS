description: Cells suffer from perturbations by different stimuli, which, consequently,
  rise to individual alterations in their profile and function that may end up affecting
  the tissue as a whole. This is no different if we consider the effect of a therapeutic
  agent on a biological system. As cells are exposed to external ligands their profile
  can change at different single-omics levels. Detecting how these changes take place
  through different sequencing technologies is key to a better understanding of ...
