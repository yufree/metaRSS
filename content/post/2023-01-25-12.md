description: Antarctic expeditions have a high risk of participant depression owing
  to long stays and isolated environments. By quantifying the stress state and changes
  in biomolecules over time before the onset of depressive symptoms, predictive markers
  of depression can be explored. Here, we evaluated the psychological changes in 30
  participants in the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition using the Patient Health
  Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Urinary samples were collected every three months for a
  year, ...
