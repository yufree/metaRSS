description: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic disturbance
  during pregnancy, with adverse effects on both mother and fetus. The establishment
  of early diagnosis and risk assessment model is of great significance for preventing
  and reducing adverse outcomes of GDM. In this study, the broad-scale perturbations
  related to GDM were explored through the integration analysis of metabolic and clinical
  phenotypes. Maternal serum samples from the first trimester were collected ...
