description: Single cell metabolomics can obtain the metabolic profiles of individual
  cells and reveal cellular heterogeneity. However, high-throughput single-cell mass
  spectrometry (MS) analysis under physiological conditions remains a great challenge
  due to the presence of complex matrix and extremely small cell volumes. Herein,
  a serpentine channel microfluidic device which was designed to achieve continuous
  cell separation and inertial focusing, was coupled with a pulsed electric ...
