description: The clinical pharmacodynamics of tacrolimus in renal transplant patients
  has significant interindividual variability. T lymphocytes were selected to study
  the pharmacodynamic response of tacrolimus, which was significantly correlated with
  renal function and the outcome of renal transplant patients. Ultra-performance liquid
  chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was performed
  to obtain the metabolic profiles of 109 renal transplant patients. A partial ...
