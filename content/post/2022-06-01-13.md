description: Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) plays an important role in the growth
  and development of tea plants. However, responses in tea plants trigged by COS have
  not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we integrated transcriptomics and
  metabolomics analysis to understand the mechanisms of chitosan-induced tea quality
  improvement and growth promotion. The combined analysis revealed an obvious link
  between the flourishing development of the tea plant and the presence of COS. It
