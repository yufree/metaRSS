description: The oral epithelium's normal morphological structure and function play
  an important role in maintaining oral homeostasis, among which microbiota and chronic
  stress are key contributing factors. However, the effects of microbiota and chronic
  stress on the morphological structures and molecular function of oral homeostasis
  remain unclear. In this study, morphological staining was used to compare the tongue
  structure of specific pathogen-free and germ-free mice, and an integrated ...
