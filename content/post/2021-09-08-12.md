description: Omic methodologies have become key analytical tools in a wide number
  of research topics such as systems biology, environmental analysis, biomedicine
  or food analysis. They are especially useful when they are combined providing a
  new perspective and a holistic view of the analytical problem. Methodologies for
  microbiota analysis have been mostly focused on genome sequencing. However, information
  provided by these metagenomic studies is limited to the identification of the presence
