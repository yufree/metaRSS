description: Through combined analysis of the transcriptome and targeted metabolome
  of lily bulbs, the possible molecular mechanism of dormancy release was revealed.
  Regulation of bulb dormancy is critical for ensuring annual production and high-quality
  cultivation. The application of low temperatures is the most effective method for
  breaking bulb dormancy, but the molecular mechanism underlying this response is
  unclear. Herein, targeted metabolome and transcriptome analyses were performed on
  Lilium ...
