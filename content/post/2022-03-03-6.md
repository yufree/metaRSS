description: Sixteen organic acids were quantified in peel and pulp of Amber, Laird's
  Large and Mulligan cultivars of tamarillo using GC-MS. Fourteen of these compounds
  had not previously been quantified in tamarillo. An untargeted metabolomics approach
  was used in parallel to identify and quantify 64 more metabolites relative to the
  internal standard, indicating abundances of glutamic acid, pro-line, aspartic acid
  and γ-aminobutyric acid as well as lower concentrations of several other essential
  fatty ...
