description: Actinidia arguta, an edible berry plant with high nutritional values,
  has been widely used in Asian countries as a food and traditional medicinal herb.
  The well-recognized health-promoting properties of A. arguta were associated with
  its bioactive components in its different botanical parts. To rapidly screen and
  identify chemical components and simultaneously determine the potential metabolites
  from different parts of A. arguta, UPLC-Q-TOF-MS^(E) coupled with UNIFI platform
  and ...
