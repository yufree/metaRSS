description: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common severe monogenic
  disorders in the world caused by a mutation on HBB gene and characterized by hemoglobin
  polymerization, erythrocyte rigidity, vaso-occlusion, chronic anemia, hemolysis,
  and vasculopathy. Recently, the scientific community has focused on the multiple
  genetic and clinical profiles of SCD. However, the lipid composition of sickle cells
  has received little attention in the literature. According to recent studies, changes
