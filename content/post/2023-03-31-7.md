description: Metabolite profiling using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
  (GC-MS) is one of the most frequently applied and standardized methods in research
  projects using metabolomics to analyze complex samples. However, more than 20 years
  after the introduction of non-targeted approaches using GC-MS, there are still unsolved
  challenges to accurate quantification in such investigations. One particularly difficult
  aspect in this respect is the occurrence of sample-dependent matrix effects. ...
