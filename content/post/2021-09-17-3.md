description: Thyroid cancer is a malignant disease with dramatically low advanced-stage
  10-year survival. Meanwhile, the metabolites in saliva are becoming a wealthy source
  of disease biomarkers. However, there is a lack of non-invasive analytical methods
  for the identification of biomarkers in saliva for the preoperative diagnosis of
  thyroid cancer. Therefore, we developed an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high
  resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) method to simultaneously determine ...
