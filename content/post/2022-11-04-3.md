description: Spaceflight entails a variety of environmental and psychological stressors
  that may have long-term physiological and genomic consequences. Metabolomics, an
  approach that investigates the terminal metabolic outputs of complex physiological
  alterations, considers the dynamic state of the human body and allows the identification
  and quantification of down-stream metabolites linked to up-stream physiological
  and genomic regulation by stress. Employing a metabolomics-based approach, this
