description: Submergence stress can severely affect plant growth. Orchardgrass (Dactylis
  glomerata L.) is an important forage grass, and the molecular mechanisms of orchardgrass
  to submergence stress are not well understood. The roots of the flood-tolerant cultivar
  "Dian Bei" were harvested at 0 h, 8 h and 24 h of submergence stress. The combined
  transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that β-alanine metabolism, flavonoid
  biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of amino acid pathways were ...
