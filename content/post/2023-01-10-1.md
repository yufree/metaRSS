description: This study aims to explore the anti-asthma components and mechanism of
  Kechuanting acupoint application therapy(KAAT) based on serum metabolomics and network
  pharmacology. A total of 60 asthma patients who had used low-dose inhaled corticosteroids-formoterol(ICS-formoterol)
  for a long time were randomized into the western medicine group(low-dose ICS-formoterol)
  and western medicine+Kechuanting group(KAAT+low-dose ICS-Formoterol), 30 in either
  group. In addition, 30 healthy people were ...
