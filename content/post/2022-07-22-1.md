description: ' <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3> <p class="a-plus-plus">Acylcarnitines
  (ACs) are metabolites involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and organic acid metabolism.
  Metabolic disorders associated to these two processes can be evaluated by determining
  the complete profile of ACs. In this research, we present an overall strategy for
  identification, confirmation, and quantitative determination of acylcarnitines in
  human serum. By this strategy we identified the presence of 47 ACs from C2 to C24
  with detection of the unsaturation degree by application of a data-independent acquisition
