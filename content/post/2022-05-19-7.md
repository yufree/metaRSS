description: Trehalose can improve the tolerance of plants to various types of environmental
  stress. Nonetheless, information respecting the molecular networks of wheat seedlings
  to exogenous trehalose under heat stress is limited. Here, two wheat varieties pretreated
  with exogenous trehalose were selected to explore the molecular mechanism by which
  trehalose improves the heat tolerance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The results
  indicated that exogenous trehalose improved the physiological state of ...
