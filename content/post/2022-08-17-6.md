description: Obesity is associated with a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state
  that supports atherosclerosis progression and platelet hyper-reactivity. During
  the last decade, the platelet lipidome has been considered a treasure trove, as
  it is a source of biomarkers for preventing and treating different pathologies.
  The goal of the present study was to determine the lipid profile of platelets from
  non-diabetic, severely obese patients compared with their age- and sex-matched lean
  controls. Lipids ...
