description: The composition of the aqueous humor of patients with type 2 diabetes
  is relevant to understanding the underlying causes of eye-related comorbidities.
  Information on the composition of aqueous humor in healthy subjects is limited due
  to the lack of adequate controls. To carry out a metabolomics study, 31 samples
  of aqueous humor from healthy subjects without ocular pathology, submitted to refractive
  surgery and seven samples from patients with type 2 diabetes without signs of ocular
