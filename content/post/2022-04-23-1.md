description: The mechanisms by which exercise benefits patients with non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease worldwide, remain poorly
  understood. A non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based
  metabolomics analysis was used to identify metabolic changes associated with NAFLD
  in humans upon exercise intervention (without diet change) across four different
  sample types-adipose tissue (AT), plasma, urine, and stool. Altogether, 46 subjects
