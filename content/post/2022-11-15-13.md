description: Radishes are root vegetables that are rich in bioactive compounds and
  provide numerous health benefits, but the overall metabolic profiles of radish taproots
  and the metabolic differences among different edible types are not fully understood.
  In this research, we used UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS to identify the metabolites in cooked,
  processed and fruit radishes of ten varieties. In total, 264 metabolites belonging
  to 18 categories were detected. A multivariate analysis revealed that the ...
