description: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic
  liver disease in most parts of the world. Although there is no first-line drug approved
  for the treatment of NAFLD, polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) is used by clinicians
  to treat NAFLD patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PPC on a mice
  model of NAFLD, and to study the PPC's mechanism of action. The mice were fed a
  choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet to induce NAFLD and were ...
