description: The antidepressant mechanism of Sini Powder was investigated by metabonomics
  based on UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and the roles of processing and compatibility in the antidepression
  of Sini Powder were discussed in the present study. The chronic unpredictable mild
  stress(CUMS) model of depression was induced in the model group, the Bupleuri Radix
  group, the Paeoniae Radix Alba group, the herb-pair group(Bupleuri Radix-Paeoniae
  Radix Alba), the Sini Powder group, and the vinegar-processed Sini ...
