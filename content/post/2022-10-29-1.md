description: The eggplant is a fruit rich in natural products and produced worldwide.
  However, its cultivation generates a large amount of scarcely used agricultural
  residues with poor chemical characterization. This study aimed to identify and quantify
  the metabolome and determine the composition of select phytochemicals and the overall
  antioxidant capacity of various anatomical parts of the plant. The plant's root,
  leaf, stem, and fruit were analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry-based ...
