description: In July 2022, the food safety accident that excessive propylene glycol
  was detected in milk processing factory raised widespread concerns about quality
  and nutrition of milk with illegal additive. To the best of our knowledge, the influences
  of propylene glycol to lipids in milk had not been systematically explored. Therefore,
  spatiotemporal distributions of lipids related to propylene glycol reaction and
  changes of sensory quality were investigated by food exogenous. Briefly, 10 ...
