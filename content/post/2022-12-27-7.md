description: β-thalassemia is one of the most common monogenic disorders and a life-threatening
  health issue in children. A cost-effective and safe therapeutic approach to treat
  this disease is to reactivate the γ-globin gene for fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production
  that has been silenced during infancy. Hydroxyurea (HU) is the only FDA approved
  HbF inducer. However, its cytotoxicity and inability to respond significantly in
  all patients pose a need for an HbF inducer with better efficacy. The study ...
