description: Metabolomics is a fundamental approach to discovering novel biomarkers
  and their potential use for precision medicine. When applied for population screening,
  NMR-based metabolomics can become a powerful clinical tool in precision oncology.
  Urine tests can be more widely accepted due to their intrinsic non-invasiveness.
  Our review provides the first exhaustive evaluation of NMR metabolomics for the
  determination of colorectal cancer (CRC) in urine. A specific search in PubMed,
  Web of Science, ...
