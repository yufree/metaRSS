description: Foodomics is the discipline aimed at studying the prevention of diseases
  by food, identifying chemical, biological and biochemical food contaminants, determining
  changes in genetically modified foods, identifying biomarkers able to confirm the
  authenticity and quality of foods or studying the safety, quality and traceability
  of foods, among other issues. It is mainly based on the use of genomic, transcriptomic,
