description: 'The pollution of soil with heavy metals is an increasingly serious worldwide
  problem, and cadmium (Cd) has attracted attention because of its high toxicity to
  almost all plants. Since castor tolerates the accumulation of heavy metals, it has
  the potential for heavy metal soil remediation. We studied the mechanism of the
  tolerance of castor to Cd stress treatments at three doses: 300 mg/L, 700 mg/L,
  and 1,000 mg/L. This research provides new ideas for revealing the defense and ...'
