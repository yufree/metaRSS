description: Stemphylium botryosum alters lentil secondary metabolism and differentially
  affects resistant and susceptible genotypes. Untargeted metabolomics identifies
  metabolites and their potential biosynthetic pathways that play a crucial role in
  resistance to S. botryosum. The molecular and metabolic processes that mediate resistance
  to stemphylium blight caused by Stemphylium botryosum Wallr. in lentil are largely
  unknown. Identifying metabolites and pathways associated with Stemphylium infection
