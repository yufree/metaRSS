description: Oral and craniofacial tissues are uniquely adapted for continuous and
  intricate functioning, including breathing, feeding, and communication. To achieve
  these vital processes, this complex is supported by incredible tissue diversity,
  variously composed of epithelia, vessels, cartilage, bone, teeth, ligaments, and
  muscles, as well as mesenchymal, adipose, and peripheral nervous tissue. Recent
  single cell and spatial multiomics assays-specifically, genomics, epigenomics, ...
