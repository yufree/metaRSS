description: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) can lead to its collapse which
  requires total hip arthroplasty. Exosomes, which are important for intercellular
  communication are involved in a series of physiological and pathological processes,
  and therefore play a unique role in disease diagnosis and treatment. In this study,
  untargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the metabolic characteristics of
  lipids in exosomes of femoral head tissue with osteonecrosis and to explain the
  metabolic ...
