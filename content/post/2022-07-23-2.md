description: Acylcarnitines (ACs) are metabolites involved in fatty acid β-oxidation
  and organic acid metabolism. Metabolic disorders associated to these two processes
  can be evaluated by determining the complete profile of ACs. In this research, we
  present an overall strategy for identification, confirmation, and quantitative determination
  of acylcarnitines in human serum. By this strategy we identified the presence of
  47 ACs from C2 to C24 with detection of the unsaturation degree by application of
