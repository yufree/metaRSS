description: The metabolomic profiles of Chinese human milk have been poorly documented.
  The objective of the study was to explore associations between human milk metabotypes,
  maternal adiposity, infant growth patterns, and risk of allergies. Two hundred mother-infant
  dyads from seven cities were randomly selected from the Chinese Human Milk Project
  (CHMP). Untargeted human milk metabolomic profiles were determined using HPLC-MS/MS.
  Two human milk metabotypes were identified using principal ...
