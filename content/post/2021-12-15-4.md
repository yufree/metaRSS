description: An untargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-high performance liquid
  chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) fingerprinting
  was applied to investigate the metabolic differences of black pepper among three
  geographical origins (Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Brazil) and two post-harvest processing
  (sterilized and non-sterilized spice). Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed
  to assess the overall clustering of samples, whereas supervised orthogonal ...
