description: Aging process is characterized by a progressive decline of several organic,
  physiological, and metabolic functions whose precise mechanism remains unclear.
  Metabolomics allows the identification of several metabolites and may contribute
  to clarifying the aging-regulated metabolic pathways. We aimed to investigate aging-related
  serum metabolic changes using a metabolomics approach. Fasting blood serum samples
  from 138 apparently healthy individuals (20-70 years old, 56% men) were analyzed
