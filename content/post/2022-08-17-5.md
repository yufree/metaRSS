description: Metabolomic profiling is an emerging field consisting of the measurement
  of metabolites in a biological system. Since metabolites can vary in relation to
  different stimuli, specific metabolic patterns can be closely related to a pathological
  process. In the dermatological setting, skin metabolomics can provide useful biomarkers
  for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of cutaneous disorders. The main goal
