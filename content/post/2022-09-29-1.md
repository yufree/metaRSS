description: Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-Q exactive orbitrap tandem
  mass spectrometry(UHPLC-QEOrbitrap-MS/MS) was used to explore the inhibitory effect
  and mechanism of ginkgo flavone aglycone(GA) combined with doxorubicin(DOX) on H22
  cells. The effects of different concentrations of GA and DOX on the viability of
  H22 cells were investigated, and combination index(CI) was used to evaluate the
  effects. In the experiments, control(CON) group, DOX group, GA group, and combined
  GA and ...
