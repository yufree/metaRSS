description: Previous studies showed that lanthanum hydroxide (LH) has a therapeutic
  effect on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and vascular calcification, which suggests
  that it might have clinical value. However, the target and mechanism of action of
  LH are unclear. Metabolomics of clinical samples can be used to predict the mechanism
  of drug action. In this study, metabolomic profiles in patients with end-stage renal
  disease (ESRD) were used to screen related signaling pathways, and we verified the
