description: Mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics provides high-dimensional datasets;
  that is, the data include various metabolite features. Data analysis begins by converting
  the raw data obtained from the MS to produce a data matrix (metabolite × concentrations).
  This is followed by several steps, such as peak integration, alignment of multiple
  data, metabolite identification, and calculation of metabolite concentrations. Each
  step yields the analytical results and the accompanying information ...
