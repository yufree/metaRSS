description: The difference of nutrient composition between organic eggs and conventional
  eggs has always been a concern of people. In this study, ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) technique combined with multivariate statistical analyses was conducted to
  identify the metabolite different in egg yolk and egg white in order to reveal the
  nutritional components information between organic and conventional eggs. The results
  showed that the nutrient content and composition characteristics were ...
