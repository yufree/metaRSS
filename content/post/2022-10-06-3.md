description: In this work, metabolic profiling of the different parts of ground cherry
  (P. pruinosa) including fruits, calyces, leaves, stems and roots using UPLC-MS/MS
  analysis combined to chemometric analysis was attempted. A total of 82 chromatographic
  peaks belonging to different metabolite classes were identified including terpenes,
  flavonoids genin and glycosides, withanolides, physalins, sucrose esters, fatty
  acids and other miscellaneous compounds with withanolides being the most predominant
