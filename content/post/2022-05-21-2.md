description: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic
  stem cell disorders. Studies have shown the involvement of an abnormal immune system
  in MDS pathogenesis. The gut microbiota are known to influence host immunity and
  metabolism, thereby contributing to the development of hematopoietic diseases. In
  this study, we performed gut microbiome and plasma metabolomic analyses in patients
  with MDS and healthy controls. We found that patients with MDS had a different ...
