description: An altered lipidome in tumors may affect not only tumor cells themselves
  but also their microenvironment. In this study, a lipidomics screen reveals increased
  amounts of phosphatidylserine (PS), particularly ether-PS (ePS), in murine mammary
  tumors compared with normal tissue. PS was produced by phosphatidylserine synthase
  1 (PTDSS1), and depletion of Ptdss1 from tumor cells in mice reduced ePS levels
  accompanied by stunted tumor growth and decreased tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)
