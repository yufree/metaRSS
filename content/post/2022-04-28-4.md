description: Lipidomics is an omics approach to comprehensively study lipid profiles
  in biological samples, such as plasma, serum, urine, and tissue specimens. Moreover,
  lipidomic analyses are useful for identifying novel lipid biomarkers, especially
  for various metabolic and malignant diseases in humans. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)
  are lipid bilayer-encapsulated nanoparticles secreted from various cells into the
  extracellular space. In particular, circulating EVs in the blood stream have ...
