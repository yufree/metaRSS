description: During pearl culture, the excess immune responses may induce nucleus
  rejection and death of pearl oysters after transplantation. To better understand
  the immune response and pearl formation, lipidomic analysis was applied to investigate
  changes in the serum lipid profile of pearl oyster Pinctada fucata martensii following
  transplantation. In total, 296 lipid species were identified by absolute quantitation.
  During wound healing, the content of TG and DG initially increased and then ...
