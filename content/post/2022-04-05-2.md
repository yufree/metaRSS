description: The transient receptor potential canonical channel 1 (TRPC1) is a ubiquitous
  Ca^(2+)-permeable integral membrane protein present in most tissues, including adipose
  and placenta, and functionally regulates energetic homeostasis. We demonstrated
  that elimination of TRPC1 in a mouse model increased body adiposity and limited
  adipose accumulation under a high fat diet (HFD) even under conditions of exercise.
  Additionally, intracellular Ca^(2+) regulates membrane lipid content via the activation
