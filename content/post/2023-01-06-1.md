description: Ophiocordyceps sinensis is a traditional medicinal fungus endemic to
  the alpine and high-altitude areas of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The scarcity of
  the wild resource has led to increased attention to artificially cultivated O. sinensis.
  However, little is known about the metabolic differences and the regulatory mechanisms
  between cultivated and wild O. sinensis. This study exploited untargeted metabolomics
  and transcriptomics to uncover the differences in accumulated metabolites and ...
