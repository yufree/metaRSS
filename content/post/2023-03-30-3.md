  disease is a rare, lysosomal disorder, characterized by intra-lysosomal glycogen
  accumulation due to an impaired function of α-glucosidase enzyme. The laboratory
  testing for Pompe is usually performed by enzyme activity, genetic test, or urine
  glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc4) screening by HPLC. Despite being a good preliminary
  marker, the Glc4 is not specific for Pompe.</p> </span> <span class="a-plus-plus
