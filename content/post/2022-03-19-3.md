description: It is unclear how vegetarian dietary patterns influence plasma metabolites
  involved in biological processes regulating chronic diseases. We sought to identify
  plasma metabolic profiles distinguishing vegans (avoiding meat, eggs, dairy) from
  non-vegetarians (consuming ≥28 g/day red meat) of the Adventist Health Study-2 cohort
  using global metabolomics profiling with ultra-performance liquid chromatography
  mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Differences in abundance of metabolites or ...
