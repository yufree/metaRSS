description: Liver cancers are rising worldwide. Between molecular and epidemiological
  studies, a research gap has emerged which might be amenable to the technique of
  metabolomics. This review investigates the current understanding of liver cancer's
  trends, etiology and its correlates with existing literature for hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and hepatoblastoma (HB). Among additional
  factors, the literature reports dysfunction in the tricarboxylic acid metabolism,
