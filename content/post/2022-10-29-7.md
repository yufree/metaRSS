description: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a kidney illness characterized by excessive
  proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia, which may lead to kidney
  failure and necessitate renal transplantation. End-stage renal disease, cardiovascular
  issues, and mortality are much more common in those with NS. Therefore, the present
  study aimed to identify potential new biomarkers associated with the pathogenesis
  and diagnosis of NS. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics
