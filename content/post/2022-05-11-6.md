description: Metabolism studies are one of the important steps in pharmaceutical research.
  LC-MS combined with metabolomics data-processing approaches have been developed
  for rapid screening of drug metabolites. Mass defect filter (MDF) is one of the
  LC/MS-based metabolomics data processing approaches and has been applied to screen
  drug metabolites. Although MDF can remove most interference ions from an incubation
  sample, the true positive rate of the retaining ions is relatively low (approximately
  10%). ...
