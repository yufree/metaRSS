description: Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) is a malignant carcinoma whose pathogenesis
  remains to be fully elucidated. System biology techniques have been widely used
  to clarify the mechanism of diseases from a systematic perspective. The present
  study aimed to explore the pathogenesis and novel potential biomarkers for the diagnosis
