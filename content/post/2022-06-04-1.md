description: In this paper, for the first time a lipidomic analysis on Pleurotus ostreatus
  species was performed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
  (LC/MS Q-TOF). Twenty-seven lipid classes, including polar and non-polar lipid classes,
  were detected. Free fatty acids (FA) were the predominant fraction (>57%), followed
  by fatty acid ester of hydroxyl fatty acid and ceramide. C18 chain length and two
  double bonds were the main structural characteristics for ...
