description: Metabolomics is the latest of the omics sciences. It attempts to measure
  and characterize metabolites-small chemical compounds <1500 Da-on cells, tissue,
  or biofluids, which are usually products of biological reactions. As metabolic reactions
  are closer to the phenotype, metabolomics has emerged as an attractive science for
  various areas of research, including personalized medicine. However, due to the
  complexity of data obtained and the absence of curated databases for ...
