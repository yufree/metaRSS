description: 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The emerging field of molecular predictive medicine
  is aiming to change the traditional medical approach in renal transplantation. Many
  studies have explored potential biomarker molecules with predictive properties in
  renal transplantation, issued from omics research. Herein, we review the biomarker
  molecules of four technologies (i.e., Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, and
  Metabolomics) associated with favorable kidney transplant ...'
