description: Monascus yellow pigments (MYPs), as food colorants, are of great interest
  to the food industry, because of their beneficial biological activities. In this
  study, a comparative metabolomics strategy revealed the metabolic regulatory mechanism
  of MYP overproduction, comparing ammonium chloride with peptone as nitrogen sources.
  Metabolomics-based multivariate regression modeling showed that metabolic biomarkers/modules,
  such as glucose, lactate, and the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, were ...
