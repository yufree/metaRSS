description: The consumption of processed foods has increased compared to that of
  fresh foods in recent years, especially due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
  Here, we evaluated the health effects of clarified apple juices (CAJs, devoid of
  pectin and additives) processed to different degrees, including not-from-concentrate
  (NFC) and from-concentrate (FC) CAJs. A 56-day experiment including a juice-switch
  after 28 days was designed. An integrated analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing and ...
