description: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinically and biologically
  heterogeneous disease. Given the heterogeneity of ARDS due to the wide range of
  etiological, clinical, and molecular manifestations, the current scientific consensus
  is that ARDS is not a single disease, but rather a set of diseases that require
  further research to properly classify and identify. Metabonomics, as a rapidly developing
  field of systems biology, has made many breakthroughs in science and medicine as
