description: High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) detects tens of thousands of
  unknown features in human plasma. Many of these features could be indicative of
  xenobiotic exposure, but identifying candidates poses a challenge due to low abundance
  and lack of authentic standards. Here we propose using co-occurrence of metabolites
  as a criterion to aid identification of undocumented xenobiotic exposures and co-exposures
  in humans. Plasma from 49 volunteer Emory University/Georgia Tech employees in ...
