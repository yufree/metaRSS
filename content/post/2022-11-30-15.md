description: Cisplatin (cDDP)-based chemotherapy is often limited by severe deleterious
  effects (nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity). The polynuclear palladium(II)
  compound Pd(2)Spermine (Pd(2)Spm) has emerged as a potential alternative drug, with
  favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. This paper reports on a Nuclear
  Magnetic Resonance metabolomics study to (i) characterize the response of mice brain
  and liver to Pd(2)Spm, compared to cDDP, and (ii) correlate ...
