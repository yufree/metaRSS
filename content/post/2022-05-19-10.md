description: Metabolomics strategies are widely used to examine obesity and type 2
  diabetes (T2D). Patients with obesity (n = 31) or T2D (n = 26) and sex- and age-matched
  controls (n = 28) were recruited, and serum and tear samples were collected. The
  concentration of 23 amino acids and 10 biogenic amines in serum and tear samples
  was analyzed. Statistical analysis and Pearson correlation analysis along with network
  analysis were carried out. Compared to controls, changes in the level of 6 analytes
