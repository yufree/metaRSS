description: The extent to which increased liver fat content influences differences
  in circulating metabolites and/or lipids between low-birth-weight (LBW) individuals,
  at increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and normal-birth-weight (NBW) controls
  is unknown. The objective of the study was to perform untargeted serum metabolomics
  and lipidomics analyses in 26 healthy, non-obese early-middle-aged LBW men, including
  five men with screen-detected and previously unrecognized non-alcoholic fatty liver
