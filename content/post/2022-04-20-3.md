description: Ochratoxin A (OTA) is one of the most widespread mycotoxin contaminants
  of agricultural crops. Despite being associated with a range of adverse health effects,
  a comprehensive systems-level mechanistic understanding of the toxicity of OTA remains
  elusive. In the present study, metabolic profiling by high-resolution magic angle
  spinning (HRMAS) NMR, coupled to intact zebrafish embryos, was employed to identify
  metabolic pathways in relation to a systems-level model of OTA toxicity. ...
