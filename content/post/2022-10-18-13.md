description: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness in working-age
  adults, is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) featured
  by metabolic disorders. With the global prevalence of diabetes, the incidence of
  DR is expected to increase. Prompt detection and the targeting of anti-oxidative
  stress intervention could effectively reduce visual impairment caused by DR. However,
  the diagnosis and treatment of DR is often delayed due to the absence of obvious
