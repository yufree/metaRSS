description: Notoginseng and safflower are commonly used traditional Chinese medicines
  for benefiting qi and activating blood circulation. A previous study by our group
  showed that the compatibility of the effective components of total saponins of notoginseng
  (NS) and total flavonoids of safflower (SF), named NS-SF, had a preventive effect
  on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. However, the
  therapeutic effect on MI and the synergistic mechanism of NS-SF are still ...
