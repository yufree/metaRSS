description: Glucosinolates (GLSs) are a group of plant secondary metabolites mainly
  found in Cruciferous plants. The main hydrolysis products of GLSs, isothiocyanates
  (ITCs), are the bioactive metabolites that have shown plant defense and human cancer
  prevention properties. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of plant metabolites can
  uncover the profiles of these bioactive phytochemicals in specific plants and discover
  potential human health promoting products. We have developed an integrated ...
