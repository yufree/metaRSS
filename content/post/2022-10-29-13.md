description: Vegetable crops possess a prominent nutri-metabolite pool that not only
  contributes to the crop performance in the fields, but also offers nutritional security
  for humans. In the pursuit of identifying, quantifying and functionally characterizing
  the cellular metabolome pool, biomolecule separation technologies, data acquisition
  platforms, chemical libraries, bioinformatics tools, databases and visualization
  techniques have come to play significant role. High-throughput metabolomics ...
