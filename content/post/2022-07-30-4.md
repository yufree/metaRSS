description: Scrophulariae Radix (SR) is one of the oldest and most frequently used
  Chinese herbs for oriental medicine in China. Before clinical use, the SR should
  be processed using different methods after harvest, such as steaming, "sweating",
  and traditional fire-drying. In order to investigate the difference in chemical
  constituents using different processing methods, the two-dimensional (2D) ¹H-^(13)C
  heteronuclear single quantum correlation (¹H-^(13)C HSQC)-based metabolomics approach
  was applied ...
