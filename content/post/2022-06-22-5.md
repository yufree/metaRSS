description: Turmeric, the rhizomes of Curcuma longa L., is one of the top selling
  spices, food preservatives, and food colorants. In addition, it exhibits health
  promoting benefits owing to its unique phytochemical composition. Nevertheless,
  it is commonly subjected to heat drying, hence, the dried powder is the most used
  form and can easily be adulterated with allied species. Therefore, our research
  aimed to profile the phytochemical composition and investigate the impact of drying
  of turmeric. ...
