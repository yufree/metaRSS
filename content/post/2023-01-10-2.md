description: To explore the mechanism of Suanzaoren Decoction(SZRD) in improving the
  insomnia rat model induced by DL-4-chlorophenylalanine(PCPA). The insomnia model
  was established by single intraperitoneal injection with PCPA(400 mg·kg~(-1)), UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS
  was used to analyze the profile of metabolites in rat hippocampus samples, combined
  with multivariate statistical analysis and screening of differential metabolites,
  and related metabolic pathways were constructed with MetaboAnalyst 5.0. ...
