description: Mislabeling and adulteration of tuna are common due to the diminishing
  of morphological characteristics during processing. The tuna authenticity is now
  being focused in the seafood supply chain. In this study, the lipid profiles of
  3 commercial tuna species (skipjack tuna, bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna) were investigated
  via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive Orbitrap
  mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap MS). A total of 439 lipid species were
