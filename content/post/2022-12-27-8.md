description: Neuropathic pain is a condition affecting the quality of life of a substantial
  part of the population, but biomarkers and treatment options are still limited.
  While this type of pain is caused by nerve damage, in which lipids play key roles,
  lipidome alterations related to nerve injury remain poorly studied. Here, we assessed
  blood lipidome alterations in a common animal model, the rat sciatic nerve crush
  injury. We analyzed alterations in blood lipid abundances between seven rats with
