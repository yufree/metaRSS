  damage have been explored in plants for hundreds of years, but limited information
  is available about its roles in regulating lipids signaling and metabolism during
  heat stress. White clover (Trifolium repens) plants were pretreated with 70 μM Spd
  and then subjected to high temperature (38/33 °C) stress for 20 days. To further
