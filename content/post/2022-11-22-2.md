description: 'High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main etiological factor
  for cervical cancer. Accumulating evidence has suggested the active role of metabolites
  in the initiation and progression of cancers. This study explored the plasma metabolic
  profiles of HPV-16 positive (HPV16 (+)), HPV-18 positive (HPV18 (+)), and HPV negative
  (CTL) individuals using a nontargeted metabolomics approach. C8 ceramide-1-Phosphate
  (d18 : 1/8 : 0) was found to inhibit cervical cancer cell proliferation ...'
