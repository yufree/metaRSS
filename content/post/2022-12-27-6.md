description: Alkaptonuria (AKU) is an ultra-rare metabolic disease caused by the accumulation
  of homogentisic acid (HGA), an intermediate product of phenylalanine and tyrosine
  degradation. AKU patients carry variants within the gene coding for homogentisate-1,2-dioxygenase
  (HGD), which are responsible for reducing the enzyme catalytic activity and the
  consequent accumulation of HGA and formation of a dark pigment called the ochronotic
  pigment. In individuals with alkaptonuria, ochronotic pigmentation ...
