description: Metabolomics helps identify metabolites to characterize/refine perturbations
  of biological pathways in living organisms. Pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical
  limitations that have hampered a wide implementation of metabolomics have been addressed.
  Several potential biomarkers originating from current targeted metabolomics-based
  approaches have been discovered. Precision medicine argues for algorithms to classify
  individuals based on susceptibility to disease, and/or by response ...
