description: 'CONCLUSION: This study showed that lipidomics can reveal honey bee neuropathologies
  associated with reduced grooming behavior due to sublethal neonicotinoid exposure.
  The ease of use, unusual brain lipidome as well as characterized behaviors that
  are affected by the environment make honey bees a promising model organism for studying
  the neurolipidome and associations with neurobehavioral ...'
