description: Colon cancer (CC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide.
  As there are no effective biomarkers for the early diagnosis and intervention tracking,
  the incidence of CC is increasing every year. Cholesterol is an important component
  of cell membrane, and it has been shown to be associated with CC. Oxysterol is an
  oxidized derivative of cholesterol, which plays an important role in many malignant
  tumors. In this study, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
  was ...
