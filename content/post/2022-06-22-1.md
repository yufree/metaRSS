description: Chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CH) and N-acetyl-p-amino-phenoltriptolide
  (APAP) are typical acentral dopamine receptor antagonists and antipyretic analgesics
  in clinical applications, respectively. However, it has been reported that these
  2 drugs could cause liver damage. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) have multiple
  physiological functions and are metabolized primarily in the liver, where it undergoes
  significant changes when the liver is damaged. In the study, 15 LPCs in the rat
  serum with ...
