description: The metabolomics approach has proved to be promising in achieving non-targeted
  screening for those unknown and unexpected (U&U) contaminants in foods, but data
  analysis is often the bottleneck of the approach. In this study, a novel metabolomics
  analytical method via seeking marker compounds in 50 pharmaceutical and personal
  care products (PPCPs) as U&U contaminants spiked into lettuce and maize matrices
  was developed, based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
