description: Metabolite profiling aiming at quantifying the metabolome of flowers
  is emerging as a suitable tool to understand the metabolic complexity of these reproductive
  organs and the associations between primary and secondary metabolites which characterize
  them. This chapter provides a general method for the combined analyses of primary
  and secondary metabolites via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance
  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of flower samples. ...
