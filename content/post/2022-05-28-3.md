description: This chapter describes protocols for the development of consensus chemical
  phenotypes or "metabolomes" of fungal populations using ultra-high pressure liquid
  chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). Isolates
  are cultured using multiple media conditions to elicit the expression of diverse
  secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. The mycelium and spent culture
  media are extracted using organic solvents and profiled by ultra-high pressure ...
