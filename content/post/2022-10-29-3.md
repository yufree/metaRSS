description: Cardiolipins (CLs) are involved in ATP production, mitochondria biogenesis,
  apoptosis and mitophagy. Their tissue distribution can provide insight into the
  function of mitochondria and related diseases. However, the reports on tissue distribution
  of CLs remain limited. In this research, CLs were identified from heart, liver,
  kidney, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and brain using ultra-high-performance liquid
  chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass ...
