description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses highlighted the close
  association of HER-2 level with the immune status and metabolic features of patients
  with GC. Metabolomics analysis highlighted the co-expressed relationship between
  alanine, aspartate and glutamate and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolisms and
  HER2 level in GC. The novel integrated multi-omics strategy used in this study may
  facilitate the development of a more tailored approach to GC ...'
