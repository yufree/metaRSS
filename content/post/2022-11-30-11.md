description: Phoebe hui is an extremely valuable tree that is the main source of the
  fragrant golden-thread nanmu wood. Although the fragrance of wood has been investigated
  in several trees, the potential substances and gene regulation mechanisms that are
  involved in fragrance formation are poorly understood. Here, three radial tissues,
  sapwood (SW), heartwood (HW), and the transition zone (TZ) in between them, were
  compared via integrative physiological, volatile-metabolomic, and transcriptomic
  analyses ...
