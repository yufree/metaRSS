description: 'CONCLUSION: Food additives and other phytochemicals were the major metabolites,
  which decreased following the exclusion of a regular diet during exclusive enteral
  nutrition. An alteration in bacterial biomarkers may reflect changes in intestinal
  microbiota composition and metabolism. Thus, metabolomics provides an opportunity
  to characterize the molecular mechanisms of dietary factors triggering Crohn''s
  Disease activity, and the mechanisms of action of exclusive enteral nutrition, ...'
