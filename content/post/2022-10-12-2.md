description: In recent years, the comprehensive analysis of saliva, i.e., salivaomics,
  has played an increasing role in biomarker discovery for disease detection in general
  and cancer specifically. Saliva is a readily accessible, non-invasive and low-cost
  specimen that can be used to detect biomarkers of clinical relevance. Saliva-based
  "omics" technologies, which include proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and
  microbiomics, have rapidly evolved and may be applicable in point-of-care detection,
