description: Non-targeted metabolomics is increasingly applied in various applications
  for understanding biological processes and finding novel biomarkers in living organisms.
  However, high-confidence identity confirmation of metabolites in complex biological
  samples is still a significant bottleneck, especially when using single-stage mass
  analysers. In the current study, a complete workflow for alternating in-source fragmentation
  on a time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) instrument for ...
