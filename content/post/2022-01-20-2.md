description: 'BACKGROUND: There has been a simultaneous increase in demand and accessibility
  across genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data, known as omics
  data. This has encouraged widespread application of omics data in life sciences,
  from personalized medicine to the discovery of underlying pathophysiology of diseases.
  Causal analysis of omics data may provide important insight into the underlying
  biological mechanisms. Existing causal analysis methods yield promising results
