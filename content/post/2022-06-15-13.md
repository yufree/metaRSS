description: Lipids are not only constituents of cellular membranes, but they are
  also key signaling mediators, thus acting as "bioactive lipids". Among the prominent
  roles exerted by bioactive lipids are immune regulation, inflammation, and maintenance
  of homeostasis. Accumulated evidence indicates the existence of a bidirectional
  relationship between the immune and nervous systems, and lipids can interact particularly
  with the aggregation and propagation of many pathogenic proteins that are ...
