description: This study adopted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole
  time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UPLC-QTOF-MS)-based untargeted metabolomic approaches
  for exploring the changes in endogenous metabolites of rat serum related to property
  differences between ginseng and American ginseng. Then the action mechanisms of
  them with warm and cool properties and the effects of processing on their property
  changes were investigated. Based on principal component analysis(PCA), the differences
