description: 'Background: Septic shock, with a prolonged hospital stay, has the highest
  mortality rate worldwide. There is a need for better management of the disease,
  which requires time-dependent analysis of alteration occurring in the disease condition
  and subsequent planning of treatment strategies to curb mortality. Objective: The
  study aims to identify early metabolic signatures associated with septic shock before
  treatment and post-treatment. It also entails the progression of patients ...'
