description: Thermal ablation is widely used in the treatment of lung cancer and is
  beneficial for the overall survival of patients in clinic. However, there is barely
  a priority in which ablation system should be chosen under different periods of
  tumor progression in lung cancer. The present study investigated different modes
  of thermal ablation systems in mice with transplanted Lewis lung carcinoma tumors
  and their various biological effects in local regions using untargeted metabolomics.
