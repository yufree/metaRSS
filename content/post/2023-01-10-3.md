description: Non-targeted metabonomics was used to investigate the metabolite changes
  in the glioblastoma orthotopic tumor-bearing mice after timosaponin AⅢ(TIA) intervention
  to explore the metabolic relevant mechanism of glioblastoma and TIA intervention.
  The mice were randomly divided into a blank group, a model group, and a TIA group.
  HPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap Elite liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect
  the metabolite changes in the serum of rats in the three groups after treatment
