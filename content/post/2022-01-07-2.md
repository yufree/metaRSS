  dehydrogenase 1A3 (ALDH1A3) is a cancer stem cell (CSC) marker and in breast cancer
  it is associated with triple-negative/basal-like subtypes and aggressive disease.
  Studies on the mechanisms of ALDH1A3 in cancer have primarily focused on gene expression
  changes induced by the enzyme; however, its effects on metabolism have thus far
  been unstudied and may reveal novel mechanisms of pathogenesis.</p> </span> <span
