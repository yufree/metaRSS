description: Population-scale expression profiling studies can provide valuable insights
  into biological and disease-underlying mechanisms. The availability of phenotypic
  traits is essential for studying clinical effects. Therefore, missing, incomplete,
  or inaccurate phenotypic information can make analyses challenging and prevent RNA-seq
  or other omics data to be reused. A possible solution are predictors that infer
  clinical or behavioral phenotypic traits from molecular data. While such predictors
