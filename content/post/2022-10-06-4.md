description: Eight lactating cows were used to determine the effects of citrus peel
  extract (CPE) on milk performance, antioxidant properties, and milk lipids composition.
  CPE supplementation up to 150 g/d (CPE150) increased milk yield and the proportions
  of unsaturated fatty acids of conjugated linoleic acid. CPE with abundant polyphenol
  and flavonoids can transfer these bioactive substances to mammary gland and improve
  the antioxidant properties of milk obtained from cows. Lipidomics revealed that
