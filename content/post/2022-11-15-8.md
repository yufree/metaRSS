description: As a staple food crop, maize is widely cultivated worldwide. Sex differentiation
  and kernel development are regulated by auxin, but the mechanism regulating its
  synthesis remains unclear. This study explored the influence of the growth stage
  of maize on the secondary metabolite accumulation and gene expression associated
  with auxin synthesis. Transcriptomics and metabonomics were used to investigate
  the changes in secondary metabolite accumulation and gene expression in maize leaves
