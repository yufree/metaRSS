description: 'CONCLUSION: This is the first study to compare the results of targeted
  and untargeted metabolomics via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to find
  the serum biomarkers which could reflect the metabolic variations among different
  stages of DR in Chinese. The progression of DR in Chinese at different critical
  stages was related to the serum levels of specific differential metabolites, of
  which there is a significant correlation between DR progression and increased IAA
  and decreased ...'
