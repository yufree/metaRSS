description: Metabolomics applied to assess the response to a body weight reduction
  program (BWRP) may generate valuable information concerning the biochemical mechanisms/pathways
  underlying the BWRP-induced cardiometabolic benefits. The aim of the present study
  was to establish the BWRP-induced changes in the metabolomic profile that characterizes
  the obese condition. In particular, a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) targeted metabolomic approach was used to determine ...
