description: Naru3 (NR) is a traditional Mongolian medicine with high clinical efficacy
  and low incidence of side effects. Metabolomics is an approach that can facilitate
  the development of traditional drugs. However, metabolomic data have a high throughput,
  sparse, high-dimensional, and small sample nature, and their classification is challenging.
  Although deep learning methods have a wide range of applications, deep learning-based
  metabolomic studies have not been widely performed. We aimed to develop ...
