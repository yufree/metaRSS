description: The relationship between sphingolipid levels and NAFLD pathology has
  been recognized for some time. Numerous studies using pharmacological and genetic
  approaches in vitro and in animal models of NAFLD have demonstrated that modifications
  to sphingolipid metabolism can attenuate various facets of NAFLD pathology. However,
  a more precise understanding of the role of sphingolipids and NAFLD pathology is
  essential to creating therapeutics that target this pathway. This chapter touches
