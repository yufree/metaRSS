description: Metabolomic analysis has proven to be a useful tool in biomarker discovery
  and the molecular classification of cancers. In order to find new biomarkers, and
  to better understand its pathological behavior, bladder cancer also has been studied
  using a metabolomics approach. In this article, we review the literature on metabolomic
  studies of bladder cancer, focusing on the different available samples (urine, blood,
  tissue samples) used to perform the studies and their relative findings. ...
