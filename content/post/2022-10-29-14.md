description: Thorough understanding of metabolic changes, including lipidome alteration,
  associated with the development of COVID-19 appears to be crucial, as new types
  of coronaviruses are still reported. In this study, we analyzed the differences
  in the plasma phospholipid profiles of the deceased COVID-19 patients, those who
  recovered and healthy people. Due to identified abnormalities in plasma phospholipid
  profiles, deceased patients were further divided into two subgroups (D1 and D2).
