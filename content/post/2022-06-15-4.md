description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Lipid mediator analysis showed that host synthesis of bioactive
  lipids is in part specific for a certain pathogen, in particular for IAV infection.
  Furthermore, MS-Imaging displayed great potential to study infections and revealed
  changes of S1P and C1P in lungs and spleen of co-infected animals, which was not
