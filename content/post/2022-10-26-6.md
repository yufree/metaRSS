description: This research characterizes key metabolites in the leaf from Citronella
  gongonha Martius (Mart.) Howard (Cardiopteridaceae). All metabolites were assessed
  in intact leaf tissue by proton (¹H) high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS)
  nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy integrated with the principal component
  analysis (PCA) to depict molecular association with the seasonal change. The major
  'known unknown' metabolites detected in ¹H HR-MAS NMR were derivatives of ...
