description: Lipidomics has great potential for the discovery of biomarkers, elucidation
  of metabolic processes and identifying dysregulations in complex biological systems.
  Concerning biofluids like plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, several studies for the
  comparison of lipid extraction solvents have already been conducted. With respect
  to tissues, which can differ significantly in terms of dry matter content and composition,
  only few studies are available. The proper selection of an extraction method ...
