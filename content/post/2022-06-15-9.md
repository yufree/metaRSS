description: The authors of this paper conducted a comparative metabolomic analysis
  of Ophiocordyceps sinensis (OS), providing the metabolic profiles of the stroma
  (OSBSz) and sclerotia (OSBSh) of OS by widely targeted metabolomics and untargeted
  metabolomics. The results showed that 778 and 1449 metabolites were identified by
  the widely targeted metabolomics and untargeted metabolomics approaches, respectively.
  The metabolites in OSBSz and OSBSh are significantly differentiated; 71 and 96 ...
