description: 2D NMR is extensively used in many different fields, and its potential
  for the study of complex biochemical or chemical mixtures has been widely demonstrated.
  2D NMR gives the ability to resolve peaks that overlap in 1D spectra, while providing
  both structural and quantitative information. However, complex mixtures are often
  analysed in situations where the data acquisition time is a crucial limitation,
  due to an ongoing chemical reaction or a moving sample from a hyphenated technique,
  or to ...
