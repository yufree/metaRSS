description: Ctenopharyngodon Idella, as a common freshwater bony fish, is more susceptible
  to various diseases than other carp species, so it has been proposed as a test organism
  for toxicological analysis In this study, C. idella were anesthetized with MS-222
  and 2-PE, and the related anesthetic mechanism and toxic effects were revealed by
  transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses. When the concentration of MS-222 was
  80 mg/L and 200 mg/L, 179 and 887 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), ...
