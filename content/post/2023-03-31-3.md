description: The beneficial effects of L-carnitine on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
  (NAFLD) were revealed in previous reports. However, the underlying mechanisms remain
  unclear. In this study, we established a high fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice
  model and systematically explored the effects and mechanisms of dietary L-carnitine
  supplementation (0.2% to 4%) on NAFLD. A lipidomics approach was conducted to identify
  specific lipid species involved in the ameliorative roles of L-carnitine in ...
