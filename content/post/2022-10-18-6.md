description: Linalool showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect, but few studies
  have elucidated the antibacterial mechanism of linalool on Pseudomonas fragi (P.
  fragi) to date. The present study aimed to uncover the antimicrobial activity and
  potential mechanism of linalool against P. fragi by determining key enzyme activities
  and metabolites combined with a high-throughput method and metabolomic pathway analysis.
  As a result, linalool had excellent inhibitory activity against P. fragi with MIC
