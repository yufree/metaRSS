description: Phytocannabinoids are isoprenylated resorcinyl polyketides produced mostly
  in glandular trichomes of Cannabis sativa L. These discoveries led to the identification
  of cannabinoid receptors, which modulate psychotropic and pharmacological reactions
  and are found primarily in the human central nervous system. As a result of the
  biogenetic process, aliphatic ketide phytocannabinoids are exclusively found in
  the cannabis species and have a limited natural distribution, whereas ...
