description: A chronic cholestasis model was induced in mice by feeding a diet containing
  3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridine(DDC). The effects of Ershiwuwei
  Songshi Pills(ESP) on endogenous metabolites in mice with chronic cholestasis were
  investigated by metabolomics analysis based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(LC-MS).
  The results showed that ESP was effective in improving pathological injury and reducing
  serum levels of alanine aminotransferase(ALT), ...
