description: Camellia vietnamensis Huang is an important woody oil crop in China,
  which has attracted much attention because of its abundant nutritional components
  and pharmaceutical value. Its seeds undergo a complex series of physiological and
  biochemical changes during maturation, with consequent alterations in metabolites.
  In order to investigate the endogenous metabolism of C. vietnamensis on Hainan Island
  during seed development, in this study, ultra-high-performance liquid tandem ...
