description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The systematic association analysis between gut microbiome
  and metabolomics reveals that fecal metabolites show the strongest association with
  the gut microbiome, followed by urine and plasma. The findings would promote the
  association study between the gut microbiome and fecal metabolome to explore key
  factors that are associated with diseases. We also provide a user-friendly web server
  and a R package to facilitate researchers to conduct the association analysis of
