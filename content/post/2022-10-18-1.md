description: Cocoa constitutes one of the richest sources of dietary flavonoids with
  demonstrated anti-diabetic potential. However, the metabolic impact of cocoa intake
  in a diabetic context remains unexplored. In this study, metabolomics tools have
  been used to investigate the potential metabolic changes induced by cocoa in type
  2 diabetes (T2D). To this end, male Zucker diabetic fatty rats were fed on standard
  (ZDF) or 10% cocoa-rich diet (ZDF-C) from week 10 to 20 of life. Cocoa supplementation
