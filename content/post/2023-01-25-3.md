description: Among the environmental factors, seasonality is the one which most affects
  the metabolome of a plant. Depending on the harvest season, the plant may have a
  variable content of certain metabolites and thus may have different biological properties.
  Foeniculum&amp;nbsp;vulgare is an annual plant whose cultivation creates large amounts
  of waste rich in bioactive compounds. The present investigation was performed with
  the aim of determining the amount of biologically active compounds in F. ...
