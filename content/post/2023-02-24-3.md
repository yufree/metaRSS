description: 'CONCLUSIONS: We extended TSP-based methods to account for covariates,
  via a simple, easy to implement residualizing process. Our covariate-adjusted TSP
  method identified metabolite features, uncorrelated from clinical covariates, that
  discriminate DKD severity stage based on the relative ordering between two features,
  and thus provide insights into future studies on the order reversals in early vs
