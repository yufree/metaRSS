description: Dry-cured mackerel is favored by consumers for its suitable salty flavor.
  Herein, the dynamic changes of volatile compounds and lipids in the mackerel, and
  the lipidomics based on UPLC-Orbitrap/MS technique during dry-cured processing were
  investigated. The results showed that endogenous lipases activities in dry-cured
  mackerel decreased. The dry-cured processing of mackerel had significant effects
  on its lipid classes and content. The contents of Arachidonic acid (C20:4n6), ...
