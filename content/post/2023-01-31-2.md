description: Endocrine tumors derive from endocrine cells with high heterogeneity
  in function, structure and embryology, and are characteristic of a marked diversity
  and tissue heterogeneity. There are still challenges in analyzing the molecular
  alternations within the heterogeneous microenvironment for endocrine tumors. Recently,
  several proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic platforms have been applied to the
  analysis of endocrine tumors to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
