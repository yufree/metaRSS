description: Browning seriously causes postharvest deterioration of the yellow cultivars
  of Flammulina filiformis, yet the browning process and its mechanism have not been
  described. Changes of L*, a*, b* values, the browning and whiteness index during
  air contacted storage were evaluated, uncovering the great loss of brightness and
  meanwhile the accumulation of yellowness and redness. Browning tissue showed an
  increase of malondialdehyde, total phenolics, and browning-related enzyme activities
