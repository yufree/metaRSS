description: Eleusine indica, which is used in traditional medicine, exhibits antiproliferative
  activity against several cancer cell lines. However, metabolomic studies to evaluate
  the metabolite changes induced by E. indica in cancer cells are still lacking. The
  present study investigated the anticancer effects of a root fraction of E. indica
  (R-S5-C1-H1) on H1299, MCF-7, and SK-HEP-1 cell lines and analyzed metabolic changes
  in the treated cancer cells using ultra-high-performance liquid ...
