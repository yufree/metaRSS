description: Scutellariae Radix(SR), derived from the dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis
  in the family Lamiaceae, commonly serves as Chinese medicinal material. Affected
  by producing areas, growing years, and harvesting periods, the quality of SR fluctuates
  in the market. However, baicalin≥9% in SR required in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2020
  edition) can only determine the qualified SR but cannot identify high-quality SR.
  To improve the quality control methods of SR, the present study analyzed ...
