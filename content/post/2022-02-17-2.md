description: Metabolomics (both targeted and untargeted) has become the gold standard
  in biomarker discovery. Whereas targeted approaches only provide information for
  the selected markers, thus hampering the determination of out-of-the-box markers,
  the common bottleneck of untargeted metabolomics is the identification of detected
  biomarkers. In this study, we developed a strategy based on derivatization and LC-MS/MS
  detection in a precursor ion scan for the untargeted determination of a specific
