description: The combination of multiple omics approaches has emerged as an innovative
  holistic scope to provide a more comprehensive view of the molecular and physiological
  events underlying human diseases (including obesity, dyslipidemias, fatty liver,
  insulin resistance, and inflammation), as well as for elucidating unique and specific
  metabolic phenotypes. These omics technologies include genomics (polymorphisms and
  other structural genetic variants), epigenomics (DNA methylation, histone ...
