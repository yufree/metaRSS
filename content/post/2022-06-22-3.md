description: This study aims to explore anti-obesity and lipid-lowering mechanism
  of Corydalis Bungeanae Herba(CB) based on intestinal microflora and metabolomics.
  Specifically, high-fat high-sugar diet(HFHS, 10 weeks) was used to induce obesity
  in rats. Then the model rats were randomized into the model group, low-dose(0.18
  g·kg~(-1)), medium-dose(0.9 g·kg~(-1)), and high-dose(1.8 g·kg~(-1)) CBH groups,
  and orlistat group(0.03 g·kg~(-1)), 12 in each group. Rats which received normal
  diet were used ...
