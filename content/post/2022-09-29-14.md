description: 'Aqueous humor (AH) is a transparent fluid that fills the anterior segment
  of the eye. The composition and level of metabolites in AH are important for understanding
  its physiology and changes caused by the occurrence of eye disease. A simple method
  for the preparation and analysis of AH samples was developed using the liquid chromatography-quadrupole
  time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) technique. The analyses were performed
  using two types of chromatography: reversed-phase ...'
