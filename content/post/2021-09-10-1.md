description: Objective To obtain the metabolome profiles in liver and serum of mice
  during normal aging. Methods The liver and serum samples of ten 2-month-old mice
  and ten 18-month-old C57BL/6J mice under physiological conditions were collected.Metabolites
  were identified and quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.The
  overall assessment,differential screening,and functional analysis were performed
  with the filtered high-quality data. Results In the negative-ion mode and ...
