description: Metabolic abnormalities lead to the dysfunction of metabolic pathways
  and metabolite accumulation or deficiency which is well-recognized hallmarks of
  diseases. Metabolite signatures that have close proximity to subject's phenotypic
  informative dimension, are useful for predicting diagnosis and prognosis of diseases
  as well as monitoring treatments. The lack of early biomarkers could lead to poor
  diagnosis and serious outcomes. Therefore, noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring
  methods with ...
