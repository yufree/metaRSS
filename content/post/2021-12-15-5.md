description: The current study applied an untargeted metabolomics approach by ultra
  high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-orbitaltrap high resolution mass
  spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Oritrap-MS) to identify the chemical composition of irradiated
  goat meat and investigate the effect of irradiation on its metabolic profile and
  meat quality. A total of 103 metabolites were identified as differential metabolites
  responsible for metabolic changes in irradiated goat meat, which were involved ...
