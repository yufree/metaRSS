description: Ceramides have been associated with cardiometabolic disease (e.g., acute
  myocardial infarction (AMI) and type 2 diabetes (T2D)) and adverse outcomes. Acute
  admission hyperglycemia (AH) is a transient glucose alteration in response to stress.
  As glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reflects the glycemia over a longer period of time,
  its use may be helpful in distinguishing between the AH and hyperglycemia associated
  with T2D in the AMI setting. The aim was to assess the correlation of ceramides
  with ...
