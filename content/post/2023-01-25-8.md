description: Apicomplexan infections, such as giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis, negatively
  impact a considerable proportion of human and commercial livestock populations.
  Despite this, the molecular mechanisms of disease, particularly the effect on the
  body beyond the gastrointestinal tract, are still poorly understood. To highlight
  host-parasite-microbiome biochemical interactions, we utilised integrated metabolomics-16S
  rRNA genomics and metabolomics-proteomics approaches in a C57BL/6J mouse model ...
