description: Aeromonas species are opportunistic bacteria causing a vast spectrum
  of human diseases, including skin and soft tissue infections, meningitis, endocarditis,
  peritonitis, gastroenteritis, and finally hemorrhagic septicemia. The aim of our
  research was to indicate the molecular alterations in proteins and lipids profiles
  resulting from Aeromonas sobria and A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida infection
  in trout kidney tissue samples. We successfully applied FT-IR (Fourier transform
