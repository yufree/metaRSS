description: This study investigated the potential mechanism of Cordyceps militaris(CM)
  against non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) based on serum untargeted metabolomics.
  Specifically, Balb/c nude mice were used to generate the human lung cancer A549
  xenograft mouse model. The tumor volume, tumor weight, and tumor inhibition rate
  in mice in the model, cisplatin, Cordyceps(low-, medium-, and high-dose), and CM(low-,
  medium-, and high-dose) groups were compared to evaluate the influence of CM on
  lung ...
