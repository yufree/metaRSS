description: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major human pathogen that requires a better
  understanding of its interaction with host cells. There is a close association of
  HCV life cycle with host lipid metabolism. Lipid droplets (LDs) have been found
  to be crucial organelles that support HCV replication and virion assembly. In addition
  to their role in replication, LDs also have protein-mediated antiviral properties
  that are activated during HCV infection. Studies have shown that HCV replicates
