description: Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support growth and invasion.
  While previous work has highlighted how single altered reactions and pathways can
  drive tumorigenesis, it remains unclear how individual changes propagate at the
  network level and eventually determine global metabolic activity. To characterize
  the metabolic lifestyle of cancer cells across pathways and genotypes, we profiled
  the intracellular metabolome of 180 pan-cancer cell lines grown in identical conditions.
