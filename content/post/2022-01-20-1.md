description: Most studies of antipsychotic-therapies have highlighted the discrepancy
  between plasma and brain pharmacokinetics of antipsychotics, but how the drug changes
  through the blood brain barrier (BBB) has not been investigated. Cell-based metabolomics
  using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) combined with multivariate
  data analysis were applied for screening of antipsychotic metabolites in the BBB.
  We applied this approach to analyze the antipsychotic biotransformation in ...
