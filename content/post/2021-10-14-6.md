description: Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) is a very useful
  analytical technique for the selective and highly efficient profiling of polar and
  charged metabolites in a wide range of biological samples. Compared to other analytical
  techniques, the use of CE-MS in metabolomics is relatively low as the approach is
  still regarded as technically challenging and not reproducible. In this chapter,
  the possibilities of CE-MS for metabolomics are highlighted with special emphasis
