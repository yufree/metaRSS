description: COVID-19 is a disease characterized by its seemingly unpredictable clinical
  outcomes. In order to better understand the molecular signature of the disease,
  a recent multi-omics study was done which looked at correlations between biomolecules
  and used a tree- based machine learning approach to predict clinical outcomes. This
  study specifically looked at patients admitted to the hospital experiencing COVID-19
  or COVID-19 like symptoms. In this paper we examine the same multi-omics data, however
