description: To explore changes in proteins and metabolites under stress circumstances,
  genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics methods are used. In-depth research over
  the previous ten years has gradually revealed the fundamental processes of plants'
  responses to environmental stress. Abiotic stresses, which include temperature extremes,
  water scarcity, and metal toxicity brought on by human activity and urbanization,
  are a major cause for concern, since they can result in unsustainable warming trends
