description: Pulp breakdown is the main reason for the reduction of fruit quality.
  However, there are relatively few studies on small molecule metabolites based on
  the pulp breakdown of dragon fruit. In this study, four dragon fruit cultivars were
  comparatively analyzed during pulp breakdown. According to five firmness-related
  and six quality-related indicators, the pulp breakdown rates from low to high were
  'Baiyulong (WP, with white pulp)', 'Dahong (RP, with red pulp)', 'Hongshuijing (CRP,
  with red ...
