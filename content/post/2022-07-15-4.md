description: Initial military training (IMT) results in increased fat-free mass (FFM)
  and decreased fat mass (FM). The underlying metabolic adaptations facilitating changes
  in body composition during IMT are unknown. The objective of this study was to assess
  changes in body composition and the serum metabolome during 22-week US Army IMT.
  Fifty-four volunteers (mean ± SD; 22 ± 3 year; 24.6 ± 3.7 kg/m² ) completed this
  longitudinal study. Body composition measurements (InBody 770) and blood samples
