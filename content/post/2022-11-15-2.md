description: More than one hundred cannabinoids have been found in cannabis. Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol
  (THC) is the recognized addictive constituent in cannabis; however, the mechanisms
  underlying THC-induced toxicity remain elusive. To better understand cannabis-induced
  toxicity, the present study compared the metabolic pathways of THC and its isomer
  cannabidiol (CBD) in human and mouse liver microsomes using the metabolomic approach.
  Thirty-two metabolites of THC were identified, including nine ...
