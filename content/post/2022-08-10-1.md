description: Lipid peroxidation products, such as short chain aldehydes, are powerful
  biomarkers of oxidative stress, due to the advantage of long lifetime compared to
  other metabolites of the lipidome. This work proposes an advanced combined derivatization/solvent-less
  extraction procedure from plasma followed by rapid Gas Chromatography with Mass
  Spectrometric detection (GC-MS). A new sample pretreatment protocol is presented
  which is based on a combination of aldehyde derivatization with ...
