description: 'CONCLUSION: These results show that C. sinensis infection can cause
  significant changes in the rat serum metabolism, especially in amino acids and lipids.
  The metabolic signature together with perturbations in metabolic pathways could
  provide more in depth understanding of clonorchiasis and further make potential
