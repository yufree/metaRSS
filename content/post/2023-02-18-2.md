description: Each year, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) results in significant economic
  loss in the cattle sector, and novel metabolic profiling for early diagnosis represents
  a promising tool for developing effective measures for disease management. Here,
  ¹H-nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR) spectra were used to characterize metabolites
  from blood plasma collected from male dairy calves (n = 10) intentionally infected
  with two of the main BRD causal agents, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV)
