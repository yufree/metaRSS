description: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the main types of Noncommunicable
  diseases (NCDs), is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by dysfunctional
  pancreatic β-cells and/or peripheral insulin resistance, resulting in impaired glucose
  and lipid metabolism. Genetic, metabolic, multiple lifestyle, and sociodemographic
  factors are known as related to high T2DM risk. Dietary lipids and lipid metabolism
  are significant metabolic modulators in T2DM and T2DM-related complications. ...
