description: This study aimed to determine the lipidome of water buffalo milk with
  intramammary infection (IMI) by non-aureus staphylococci (NAS), also defined as
  coagulase-negative staphylococci, using an untargeted lipidomic approach. Non-aureus
  Staphylococci are the most frequently isolated pathogens from dairy water buffalo
  milk during mastitis. A total of 17 milk samples from quarters affected by NAS-IMI
  were collected, and the lipidome was determined by liquid chromatography-quadrupole
